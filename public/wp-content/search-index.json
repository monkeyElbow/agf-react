AGFinancial Insurance offers personal insurance products including life insurance and mission trip travel insurance. BUTTON What options are available for life insurance? AGFinancial Insurance offers individual life insurance, group insurance for credentialed AG ministers, and “key man” life insurance for pastors and ministry leaders. BUTTON Do you offer Christian insurance plans for missions’ trips? Yes, we offer travel insurance plans for those trips associated with AG missionaries or ministries. What insurance coverage does my church need? Every church needs two types of insurance: property and liability (casualty). Property insurance covers the things the church owns and should be calculated based on what it would cost to replace them (replacement cost value). Liability insurance covers actions that could leave the church liable for damage to others, including injuries, possessions, and reputations. In our experience, it is crucial for churches to have at least the following liability coverages: General Sexual misconduct Directors, officers, and trustees (DOT) General Business auto Hired and non-owned auto Pastoral counseling Workers’ compensation What property coverage is best—actual cash value or replacement cost? Most churches should secure coverage based on the replacement cost value. This will provide enough coverage to rebuild facilities or replace property with new items of like kind and quality. Make sure your agent secures an appraisal to determine the replacement cost for your building. Who needs workers’ compensation insruance? Every church should have workers’ compensation insurance. It is not subject to a deductible and includes medical payments for all employees as well as disability payments until the employee can return to work. What is risk management and why is it important? Risk management is the process of assessing the likelihood of an accident and its potential financial impact on your church—increased insurance premiums, damaged reputation, financial settlements, legal fees—and then taking steps to help prevent the accident before it happens. But more than just helping you avoid an expensive lawsuit, risk management is about protecting those to whom you minister. You’ve been entrusted with providing a safe place for people to learn and worship. Comprehensive risk management policies both maximize the safety of your congregation and minimize liability for your church. What is a coinsurance penalty? Coinsurance is the percentage of insurance to the property value. Most companies require that a coinsurance rate of 80% or 90% of the property value be in place at the time of a loss. If this percentage is not met, a coinsurance penalty may result in the event of a claim. For example, if your property is worth $100,000 and the coinsurance requirement is 80%, there would need to be at least $80,000 of coverage in place to pay a claim without incurring a penalty. This penalty could be costly. It is determined by taking the amount of coverage you have and dividing it by the amount of coverage you should have according to the coinsurance requirement. Continuing with the above example, if you have $40,000 of coverage instead of $80,000 (50% of the amount required), the insurance company may penalize you by paying only 50% of your loss. To avoid a coinsurance penalty, ask your agent for an Agreed Value endorsement on your policy, in addition to insuring your property according to its replacement cost. This endorsement waives any potential coinsurance penalty. There is a small additional cost with most insurance carriers to add this endorsement. What is key man insurance and who needs it? Key man insurance is a life insurance policy for one or more lead pastors, administrators, etc. A key man policy is owned by the ministry and is meant to help compensate the ministry for the death of one of its key leaders. The death benefit can help a church show financial strength to creditors, conduct a proper search for a replacement without worrying about immediate financial needs, and promote a general succession plan. Ministries should consider a key man policy for the following reasons and circumstances: To insure the life of any employee who has exceptional knowledge of the intricacies of the ministry When the reputation of the church is directly tied to the charisma of the pastor If a bank or lender is requiring a guarantee on their business loans To see how much coverage you need, check out our article “Losing a Leader: How Key Man Insurance Can Help a Church Recover”.

You contribute cash, stocks, real estate, or other assets to AG Foundation to establish the trust. The trust pays income to the ministry(ies) you’ve selected for a set number of years. When the trust ends, the remaining assets return to you or transfer to your family—often with significant growth in value. Grantor Lead Trust Donor receives remainder of trust after stated period of time Charitable income tax deduction (equal to the total value of the income payments to ministry) is given in the year the trust is created Donor is taxed on the trust’s income each year Non-Grantor Lead Trust A named beneficiary, ministry, or heirs receive remainder of trust after predetermined payout period Permanent transfer of asset Reduces gift or estate tax and removes asset from estate Income is taxed at the trust level each year A Guide to Trust Types Charitable Remainder Trusts and Charitable Lead Trusts offer unique benefits and have different requirements. How It Works: Remainder Trusts To establish a Charitable Remainder Trust, assets are transferred to AG Foundation which, in turn, pays you income according to the terms of the trust. You can receive lifetime income payments for yourself and a spouse, and up to 20 years to third parties, such as children. Upon completion of the trust’s term, the remainder of the trust’s principal is transferred to the ministry of your choice. Assets You May Give A Charitable Remainder Trust is an excellent alternative to an outright sale of appreciated securities, real estate or other marketable assets due to its charitable and capital gain tax benefits, but it can also be funded with cash. The funding of the trust creates an immediate charitable tax deduction, and property sold through the trust avoids imposition of upfront capital gains. Minimum required funding is $50,000 for cash or securities, or $100,000 for real estate. How It Works: Lead Trusts A Charitable Lead Trust functions in somewhat the opposite way of a Charitable Remainder Trust. You make a contribution of cash or property to fund the irrevocable trust. The trust makes income payments to the ministry for a set number of years. You receive a charitable deduction for the gift. Upon completion, the asset then returns back to you or transfers to your family along with any additional growth in value. Assets You May Give These are best funded with cash, income-producing securities, real estate, or other assets. Minimum required funding is $50,000 for cash or securities, or $100,000 for real estate. A Charitable Lead Trust does not have capital gains benefits, and income generated by the trust may be taxable to you. However, this type of trust can also be useful in reducing taxes on large estates and making tax-advantaged transfers to your children. First Name* Last Name* Phone* Email* Submit Income and impact .

Actual annual housing expenses for this year (see Total Housing Expenses) Actual annual Fair Rental Value (home + furniture + utilities) The following description is intended to provide guidelines under which a minister may declare housing on retirement account disbursements: What constitutes retirement for purposes of these rules regarding SECA tax and the housing allowance depends on an individual’s particular facts and circumstances. Ministers with questions about whether they are retired for this purpose should consult their tax advisors. Ultimately, the minister must make this decision. Many facts and circumstances may be relevant in determining whether retirement has occurred. For example, if a minister is receiving retirement benefits from a plan and is making contributions to the same plan, the IRS may not consider that minister retired for purposes of the housing allowance and the favorable SECA tax treatment. Similarly, the IRS may view ministers as not retired if they have not had a meaningful break in service or change in work duties. Additionally, the IRS may not view you as retired if you are RMD age and have filed the paperwork to delay a required minimum distribution from your retirement account. Ministers and their tax advisors should work together to address the relevant facts and circumstances of each individual case.
