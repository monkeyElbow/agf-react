    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p><strong>For Andy and Margaret, generosity has never been an afterthought.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It’s been one of the defining principles of their family since the early days of their marriage. They wanted their home to be shaped by a spirit of giving—something their kids would see, experience, and eventually own for themselves.</p>\n<p>“We wanted generosity to anchor our family,” Andy shares. “It’s kept our hearts aligned with what God is doing.”</p>\n<p>That value shaped their giving habits early on, even when finances were tight, and later guided them as their careers grew—Margaret through campus ministry with Chi Alpha and Andy through the tech world. Over time, they developed a focused approach to giving: supporting widows and orphans, investing in campus missionaries, and strengthening their local church.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s for the kids, too.</strong></p>\n<p>One of their favorite family traditions that developed as their children grew was to set aside some of their giving for their children to direct. Through their own research, the children would discuss needs of faith-based ministries, and choose where to allocate the gifts. This tradition has helped the younger generation discover new ministries while taking ownership of their own generosity.</p>\n<p>“It’s been meaningful watching them light up about ministries they’ve found,” Andy remarks. “It’s become part of how they live out their faith.”</p>\n<p><strong>Donor Advised Funds changed everything.</strong></p>\n<p>Before discovering Donor Advised Funds (DAFs), giving noncash gifts like appreciated stock was a complicated process—tracking down ministry account numbers, handling transfers manually, and navigating layers of verification and bureaucracy.</p>\n<p><strong>A DAF simplified everything.</strong></p>\n<p>“It streamlined the entire process,” Andy mentions, “And with AGFinancial, giving became truly frictionless.”</p>\n<p>What stood out to them about AGFinancial?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><i>Grant requests:</i> Always simple and relational.</li>\n<li><i>No unnecessary red tape</i>: AGFinancial understands ministries, removing the bureaucracy encountered elsewhere.</li>\n<li><i>The ministry receives the full value of the gift:</i> By giving appreciated assets directly, no portion is lost to taxes.</li>\n<li><i>Kingdom impact even before the gift is granted: </i>Undistributed DAF funds are used to provide loans to churches for ministry growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“It’s a much more effective way to give,” Margaret adds. “Everything is organized in one place. Tax season is easier, and every dollar goes farther.”</p>\n<p><strong>A tool for every generation.</strong></p>\n<p>Many people assume DAFs are for older adults, but Andy and Margaret know otherwise.</p>\n<p>“It’s not an age issue—it’s a knowledge issue,” Andy says. Young professionals with even small amounts of appreciated assets can start giving more strategically right away. Their own children have already begun setting up DAFs, including through AGFinancial.</p>\n<p>AGFinancial’s Donor Advised Funds have not only made giving easier for Andy and Margaret, but their use has amplified the impact of their family giving, and helped extend their legacy of generosity to the next generation.</p>\n<p>“It ensures every penny we give is going to the Kingdom,” Andy comments. “And that’s exactly what we want.”</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to give cash, appreciated assets, or something else? &nbsp;Let's discover the best, easiest way to make the most of your generosity.

A gift of cash or appreciated stock may be completed quickly right up to year-end. <i>A gift of real estate usually takes more time to complete properly</i> but is well worth considering because of the tremendous tax benefits.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for giving options that provide tax benefits for you, you may want to consider one or more of the following. It's a lot of information, so buckle up.</p>\n<p><strong>Donor Advised Fund (DAF). </strong>As the fastest-growing charitable giving vehicle within the United States, the DAF can be funded with cash, securities, real estate, and more. You may be eligible to receive an immediate tax deduction in the year funding is completed and if funded with appreciated assets, you may avoid capital gains thereby increasing the giving capacity of the assets given. You can realize the tax benefits now, while directing the timing of the recommended grants to the ministries and charities of your choice at a later date if desired. In addition, anonymous giving is available with a DAF. <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/planned-giving/planned-giving-tools/donor-advised-funds/\">Learn more about DAFs.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Qualified Charitable Distribution.</strong> If you are age 70½ or older, you can make a charitable distribution from your IRA to a qualified 501(c)(3) charity. A <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/reducing-your-taxes-qcd/\">qualified charitable distribution</a> (QCD) can be made directly from your IRA to a qualified public charity, and the distribution will not be treated as taxable income to the donor. In addition to providing tax advantages, a QCD would satisfy your required minimum distribution (RMD) amount. If you are age 70½ or older, you are permitted to transfer up to $108,000 for 2025* directly to charity tax-free each year, even if that amount is higher than your RMD.</p>\n<p>The<strong> SECURE 2.0 Act </strong>allows you to distribute funds from your IRA—up to $54,000* of your annual Qualified Charitable Distribution limit (QCD)—into a<a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/services/individual-services/individual-planned-giving/charitable-gift-annuities\"> Charitable Gift Annuity.</a>** <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/resources/article/opportunity\">Learn more about QCDs to a Charitable Gift Annuity</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Family Gifts.</strong> If circumstances allow you to start transferring some of your wealth to children and grandchildren, consider making annual exemption gifts. For 2025, you are eligible to give $19,000 per person to any number of individuals free from gift tax.</p>\n<p>That's a lot to consider. Thankfully, you're not on your own.

The labor concerns are real. The cost of construction materials is real. Your concern or anxiety regarding whether to proceed with your ministry's construction project? That's real, too.</p>\n<p>In this sort of market, is it responsible—is it part of good stewardship—for a church or other ministry to move forward with its plan to grow? If so, how can unknowns be managed proactively and appropriately?</p>\n<p>Great questions. Continue reading for some answers. <strong>Hint: there's good news…</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reality check.</strong></p>\n<p>If you're looking for data on whether construction material costs are volatile and increasing, you'll find it. The truth is construction costs are going to increase (they always do). The deeper truth? The cost of a project today is going to be less than it will be at this time next year (it always is).</p>\n<p>Tariffs, the looming threat of additional tariffs, and any other factor that could cause potential construction cost increases can be mitigated. These are not good reasons to avoid a construction project—especially not when the vision, support, momentum, and timing seem to be right for a church or ministry.</p>\n<p><strong>The labor challenge.</strong></p>\n<p>The increase of material prices is another ‘usual suspect’ posing a risk to the construction industry. Considering the U.S. imports almost half these materials from Canada, Mexico and China, this is a reasonable concern. There is, however, a more concerning issue: a potentially dwindling U.S. workforce. </p>\n<p>More of the labor force is retiring than entering it. “…those retiring are not being readily replaced by the next generation.” (<a href=\"https://www.uschamber.com/workforce/understanding-americas-labor-shortage\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. Chamber of Commerce,</a> June 2025)</p>\n<p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/forbrn.nr0.htm\" rel=\"noopener\">foreign-born workers comprise 19.2%</a> of the U.S. labor force. That's a significant portion of the workforce, and economic analysts note that changes in immigration policy could impact various sectors that rely heavily on these workers as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Same song, different verse.</strong></p>\n<p>Whether it's attributed to tariffs, raw material costs, labor shortages, petroleum costs, environmental regulations, or outright price gauging, this volatility is not new. Headlines can easily elicit uncertainty, cold feet, and second-guessing.</p>\n<p><strong>There is good news, though.</strong> With a strategic approach, most construction projects can continue to move forward in pursuit of the people's vision, and within God's timing. <em>Here's how.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Construction Management 101: 9 Strategies</strong></p>\n<p>AGFinancial's construction services team recommends these specific strategies before entering any sort of build contract or construction agreement:</p>\n<p><em>1. Choose your partners wisely</em></p>\n<p>Engage trusted, experienced contractors with excellent reputations and credit relationships. Their suppliers and vendors will work to protect their best customers from price increases, so you as the end user will benefit, too.</p>\n<p><em>2. Lock in your price</em></p>\n<p>Never agree to open-ended contracts or agreements. Ensure there is a \"guaranteed maximum price\" or \"not to exceed\" contract amount.</p>\n<p><em>3. Protect against increases</em></p>\n<p>Ensure all contracts and agreements protect both contractor and owner from unforeseen price increases upon execution of the agreement and financial commitment. This may involve additional deposits or down payments to secure materials, so be sure storage is secured (if necessary), and the product is insured through a Builder's Risk Insurance policy.</p>\n<p><em>4. Explore alternatives</em></p>\n<p>Work with your contractor and/or sub-contractors to identify alternate models or brands other than what was specified by the designer, architect or engineer.</p>\n<p><em>5. Order early</em></p>\n<p>Order and secure materials as soon as possible to avoid future volatility.</p>\n<p><em>6. Plan for tariff exposure</em></p>\n<p>If specific materials require importing and expose the contractor to possible tariffs, consider a \"Fair Notice Provision\" requiring the supplier to notify all parties of the increase. This allows time to adjust budgets accordingly through the use of contingency or cost-reduction in other areas.</p>\n<p><em>7. Share the risk</em></p>\n<p>If the cost increase potential cannot be mitigated, ask the supplier to consider \"sharing\" the cost, and/or \"capping\" the cost increase to an agreed amount or percentage. An identified increase is always better than an unknown or unlimited one.</p>\n<p><em>8. Plan for flexibility</em></p>\n<p>Identify project elements that can be delayed to later phases. Set aside 10-12% of total project cost as contingency to cover deferred items and unexpected costs. Reduce this buffer as the project progresses and risks become clearer.</p>\n<p><em>9. Create specific contingencies</em></p>\n<p>Consider a specific line-item contingency for items that cannot include a guaranteed cost or that would be subject to a possible tariff or increase; so the worst-case cost is actually in the contract, but the owner realizes the savings if the cost winds up being less.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re not alone.</strong></p>\n<p>If that all seems overwhelming, it's ok. Managing construction, its unknowns, and dealing with 'surprises' that may impact your project are very real challenges. Identifying worst-case scenario costs and anticipating those unknowns (as much as possible) are best practices.</p>\n<p><strong>In spite of headlines, labor concerns, and construction's inevitable increasing costs, projects in the U.S. are proceeding. Yours can, too.</strong></p>\n<p>AGFinancial's construction loan team remains committed to walking with ministries through these challenges. Our priorities are proactive consulting and seeing your project through completion and beyond to ensure the results are best for your ministry.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <h4>... and how to navigate today’s volatile markets.</h4>\n<p>Let's face it—investing these days feels a bit like riding a roller coaster blindfolded, doesn't it? After years of helping people navigate the ups and downs of the market, we’ve noticed three big mistakes they often make, especially in wild markets like this.</p>\n<p>Grab your coffee, hot tea, or zero-sugar soda, and let's discuss keeping your investments on track even when the market seems to have other plans.</p>\n<h4><strong>1. Emotions taking the wheel</strong></h4>\n<p>A common question we receive is, <strong>\"With all this craziness, when's the right time to jump in?\"</strong></p>\n<p>It's a fair question! Especially when the market is bouncing around like a pinball. But here's the thing—when our emotions start making our investment decisions, we usually get it backward.</p>\n<p>Think about it. Fear makes us sell when prices drop (exactly when we should be considering buying), and FOMO (fear of missing out) pushes us to buy when everyone's celebrating high prices (precisely when caution might be smart).</p>\n<p>Warren Buffett offers this guidance: <em>\"Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.\"</em> In other words, when everyone's panicking about tariffs and selling, that might be your opportunity. When everyone's celebrating, maybe take a breath before diving in.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Your emotions will always try to hijack your investment decisions—especially when panicky headlines are flying. Recognize those feelings, but don't let them drive your financial car.</p>\n<h4><strong>2. Trying to time the market</strong></h4>\n<p>We've all thought about it. \"If I just sell before the next drop and buy right before things go up again...\" Seems logical, right?</p>\n<p>But here's the reality check—even the pros struggle to get this right.</p>\n<p>Just last month, we saw sectors that analysts thought would get hammered by tariffs bounce back within days, while supposedly \"safe\" industries took unexpected hits from supply chain problems. Who could have predicted that?</p>\n<p>Peter Lynch really hits home here, <em>\"More money has been lost preparing for corrections than in the corrections themselves.\"</em></p>\n<p>Here’s something to consider: If you invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 from January 1, 2004 to December 29, 2023 (through some truly scary times like the 2008 crash and the pandemic), you’d have averaged about 9.7% returns annually. But—and this is huge—if you missed just the 10 best days (keep in mind, that is 10 of the best days out of 5,000 days over that 20-year time period), your average returns would have only been 5.5% annually! If you missed 20 of the best days out of 5,000 days, your average return drops to just 2.8%!<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>And guess when many of those \"best days\" happened? Right after some of the worst drops or following major policy announcements that initially scared everyone. Talk about terrible timing!</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Instead of trying to outsmart the volatility and news, focus on staying in the game. Think of it like swimming in the ocean—you can't control the waves, but you can learn to ride them out.</p>\n<h4><strong>3. Misjudging how much turbulence you can handle</strong></h4>\n<p>We all like to think we have nerves of steel, right? But there's nothing like a 1,000-point market drop in a single day to test that theory!</p>\n<p>Many investors discover their true risk tolerance only when they're watching their portfolio drop by thousands of dollars in real-time. Suddenly, that \"aggressive growth strategy\" doesn't seem so appealing.</p>\n<p>Risk isn't just some theoretical concept—it's that knot in your stomach when markets tumble. And that feeling changes throughout your life.</p>\n<p>When you're 30, you theoretically have time to recover from market swings. But if those wild fluctuations keep you up at night or, worse, push you to make panic decisions, then maybe your actual risk tolerance isn't what you thought it was—regardless of what some textbook says about your age group.</p>\n<p>Those looking for a bit more stability in these choppy waters might wish to consider an investment option that delivers steady returns regardless of market drama.<sup></sup></p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Be honest with yourself about how much market drama you can really handle. There's no medal for taking on more risk than you can stomach.</p>\n<h4><strong>Remember… you’re the captain of this ship</strong></h4>\n<p>Markets will always have their wild moments—that's just their nature. </p>\n<p>But here's the good news: how you respond to all this noise is far more important than the noise itself. Stay cool when others panic, stick to your plan despite the headlines, and consider diversifying your investments and keeping your focus on the long-term.<em></p>\n<p></em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><sup>1</sup> Source: JP Morgan Asset Management.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Downward-trending mortgage rates, even amidst the high cost of construction, may be cracking open a window of opportunity for your church. This could be the intersection—finally!—of timing and your vision to better reach and serve your community. </p>\n<p><strong>It’s never easy, is it? </strong></p>\n<p>Trying to decide the right timing to build or expand your church’s facilities is tough. You know the need, you have the desire, and most importantly, you want confirmation of God’s timing…especially when everything seems to be so expensive.</p>\n<p>It may seem counterintuitive for your church to consider new construction, remodeling, or purchasing a building. <em>However, now may be just the time to pursue that vision.</em> </p>\n<p>Here’s why.</p>\n<p>Though the actual increase of construction spending may slow in 2025 (<a href=\"https://www.aia.org/resource-center/july-2024-aia-consensus-construction-forecast\">American Institute of Architects</a>) compared to recent years, high construction costs aren’t going anywhere. While we try to avoid saying things like, “new normal,” the reality is historically, construction costs increase. There isn’t a single cause responsible for increases, according to a <a href=\"https://www.commercialsearch.com/news/construction-costs-continue-to-rise-in-2024/\">2024 JLL (global real estate company) report</a>. Rising insurance premiums and higher labor costs, driven by a massive shortage of skilled construction workers, both contribute to construction increases, in addition to the actual materials.</p>\n<p><strong>But wait…! </strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-interest-rates-forecast/\">Forbes recently shared</a>, mortgage rates are trending downward. Lower rates, naturally, make financing a construction or renovation project more affordable; however, declining rates often lead to increased demand for construction loans, which can drive up demand for contractors, subcontractors, and other laborers. Locking in a low rate now can provide long-term savings, as these favorable terms can stretch over decades, reducing the overall cost of borrowing. That means now could be a prime opportunity for a church to pursue its vision and invest in its future.</p>\n<p>Here’s the reality for churches: the trajectory of construction costs will always be upward, and of course, interest rates fluctuate. “Is this a good time to build?” is only half the question. From a ministry perspective, the full question is, “Is this a good time to build the facility we need to carry out God’s plan for our church?”</p>\n<p><strong>The bottom line? </strong></p>\n<p>This may be a window of opportunity—somewhere between high rates and a hotly competitive construction demand—for your church to increase its capacity for reaching your community.</p>\n<p>Coupled with the more favorable mortgage market is a new church loan option offered by AGFinancial, in which <em>your rate lowers automatically* as the market rate lowers.</em> This option virtually eliminates any regrets over having locked-in a rate, only to witness the market lower the next day.</p>\n<p>Pursue your vision.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Beyond words of encouragement and gift cards to their favorite taco dives, planning for future financial well-being is one of the greatest ways a church can express its appreciation for a pastor. It not only demonstrates a profound way to care for the pastor’s family; setting up retirement savings for a pastor can be beneficial and responsible for a church, too. Here are three reasons a church should consider doing so.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial Stability and Well-Being</strong></p>\n<p>Providing retirement savings for a pastor ensures their financial stability and well-being during their retirement years. Pastors dedicate their lives to serving the church and often receive modest salaries, which may not provide sufficient funds for a comfortable retirement. By setting up retirement savings, the church can help the pastor build a nest egg, ensuring they have financial security in their later years.</p>\n<p><strong>Attracting and Retaining Pastoral Talent</strong></p>\n<p>A retirement savings plan can serve as an attractive benefit for potential pastors, as well as a valuable tool for retaining current ones. Pastoral ministry is a calling that requires deep commitment, but it's also a vocation that requires financial support. Offering retirement savings demonstrates the church's commitment to the long-term well-being of its pastors and their families, making it more appealing for qualified candidates to join and stay within the church.</p>\n<p><strong>Demonstration of Stewardship</strong></p>\n<p>Establishing retirement savings for the pastor reflects the church's commitment to good stewardship and responsible financial management. Churches have a responsibility to manage their resources wisely, including the compensation and benefits provided to their staff members. By prioritizing retirement savings, the church demonstrates its dedication to fulfilling its obligations to its pastors, ensuring their welfare beyond their active service, and creating a sustainable source of blessing for the future.</p>\n<p>It's important for churches to consult with financial professionals and explore different retirement savings options to determine the most suitable plan for their specific circumstances. <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/find-a-consultant?specialty=retirement\">AGFinancial retirement consultants</a> can help your church navigate this exploration.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>It’s been said “Relationships aren’t the most important thing; they are the only thing.” As followers of Jesus, as family, as friends, as neighbors, we know this is true. Not surprisingly, it’s also true of the relationship between a church and its lender. In fact, a church's good relationship with its lender is crucial. Here are three important reasons why:</p>\n<p><strong>Financial Stability<br /></strong></p>\n<p>A good relationship with the lender helps ensure financial stability for the church. When a church borrows money, it relies on the lender's support. A positive relationship fosters trust and reliability between the two parties, allowing the church to access necessary funds when needed. This stability enables the church to meet its financial obligations, like paying staff, maintaining its facilities, and funding its ministries and programs.</p>\n<p><strong>Favorable Loan Terms</strong></p>\n<p>A strong relationship with the lender can even lead to more favorable loan terms. Lenders are more likely to offer competitive interest rates and more flexible repayment options to organizations they trust. This can significantly impact the financial health of the church, as it can reduce the burden of debt and free up resources for ministry opportunities. Additionally, a positive relationship may also pave the way for obtaining future funding when necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-Term Support and Collaboration</strong></p>\n<p>Nurturing a relationship with the lender establishes a foundation for long-term support and collaboration. Churches have evolving needs. A strong relationship with the lender allows the church to discuss its plans, seek advice, and potentially gain the lender's support for future projects. It can also lead to a more open and cooperative atmosphere, helping the lender understand a ministry’s unique challenges and goals.</p>\n<p>Overall, a good relationship with a lender helps a church effectively manage its finances and obligations, and pursue its mission and vision with the support of a trusted partner.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Every healthy church has its calling (like yours). Every healthy church is unique (like yours). At some point, every healthy church (like yours) will need a financial partner. Secure your church loan—for construction, purchasing a building, renovations, or addressing “opportunity areas” like those parking lot cracks—from a lender who has a deep understanding of ministry. Here are three pros for doing so.</p>\n<p><strong>Shared Values</strong></p>\n<p>Choosing a lender who understands ministry ensures alignment with shared values and beliefs. Churches can have confidence their financial institution understands and supports their mission, vision, and goals as unique and God-given. This foundation of shared beliefs fosters a stronger partnership and sense of community, as both the church and the lender work together toward growing the Kingdom.</p>\n<p><strong>Customized Services</strong></p>\n<p>A lender specializing in church loans has a deep understanding of the unique financial needs and challenges faced by ministries. They can offer customized products and services designed to address the specific needs of a church, such as flexible repayment terms, interest rates, and loan structures. These lenders also offer expertise in dealing with properties and can navigate the complexities of church financing more effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Support for Ministry</strong></p>\n<p>Partnering with a ministry-focused lender contributes to the broader Christian community. The interest and fees generated from these loans are reinvested to support other ministry initiatives and programs. In this way, churches actively participate in a cycle of support, in which their financial decisions benefit both their own organization and other Kingdom endeavors. This creates a sense of unity and shared stewardship among the Christian community, fostering mutual support and encouragement. One body, one family, one Church.</p>\n<p>While we’d love to provide some “cons” to balance out the list in the fairest way possible, we really can’t think of any.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0811-covid-guidance.html\">new COVID-19 guidelines</a>. As active community organizations, it’s important for churches to understand these updates. New guidelines can lead to confusion among church leaders and congregants alike, and it’s easy to get confused. For example, your church requiring attendees to stand at least six feet apart in gatherings is no longer following an official CDC guideline. Your church’s policy requiring people not up-to-date on vaccinations to self-quarantine if they have been in close contact with someone COVID-positive is also no longer among the guidelines. </p>\n<p>Here’s the problem: much like the COVID-19 virus mutates and changes, so it seems do the CDC guidelines. When a church’s policies are stricter than the government’s, that church may be at risk of a lawsuit. Even worse, that church can also be at risk of a potential discrimination lawsuit from its own employees and staff. A sensible preventative measure is for churches to both review and update their insurance policies. A policy review should be built into a church’s annual plan, regardless of current health or other crises. </p>\n<p>“A discrimination lawsuit can cost a church thousands of dollars,” says Jerry Sparks, SVP, President, AGFinancial Insurance. “It’s important to protect your church and keep up to date on changing policies.” </p>\n<p>AGFinancial Insurance has partnered with churches, helping them through discrimination lawsuits. Your church can be proactive, reviewing and selecting updated insurance policies to better protect its congregants, staff, facilities, and reputation.

If so, chances are you’ve already wondered ”What should I do with my refund?“ </p>\n<p>You are not alone. It’s common for tax refunds to be put into savings, used to pay down debt, spent on a major purchase, or even put towards a vacation—probably all things you’ve considered.</p>\n<p>It’s important to remember this: <em>a tax refund is not a bonus</em>. It’s money the government borrowed from you for a while, interest free, and is now being returned.

By saving your refund for an unexpected financial event, you can be more prepared for sudden expenses.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>In this digital age, everything an organization does must have a cyber security component because technology touches every aspect of our lives. Churches often store the personal and financial information of their members, which can be tempting to hackers who are looking for ways to steal such information.</p>\n<p>In the past 10 years, there have been data breaches at major companies, like Equifax, Yahoo!, and Target. These breaches occur when sensitive information is stolen digitally, and churches and ministries are just as vulnerable to data breaches as any other business or institution. In fact, a data breach is more likely than a terrorist attack, but many churches are more prepared for physical security issues than digital ones.</p>\n<p>If your church is hit with a data breach, it will cost you in time and money, as well as severely damage your ministry’s reputation. Fortunately, there are ways to reduce the risk of a data breach and to protect your church and its members’ information. Below are a few steps your church can take to help keep your data safe.</p>\n<p>Never reuse passwords. More than 80% of people age 18 and older <a href=\"https://mashable.com/2017/02/28/passwords-reuse-study-keeper-security/#_IRztRd168qX\" rel=\"noopener\">reuse the same password</a> across multiple accounts. It’s easier to remember a few simple passwords instead of multiple complex ones, but reusing passwords puts your information at risk. You should also make sure your passwords are tough to guess—some of the most commonly hacked passwords include words like “God” and “Jesus.”</p>\n<p>Limit password access and train staff to keep passwords private. In addition, be sure to issue new passwords every time an employee or volunteer stops working in the office.</p>\n<p>Keep software updated. Set computers to automatically check for updates and install them right away, instead of putting them off. Old versions of software, browsers, and operating systems often have security issues that are repaired in the updated versions. Forty-four percent of data breaches used <a href=\"http://newsroom.bmc.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=253321&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2126044\" rel=\"noopener\">known vulnerabilities</a>, meaning the attacks could easily have been prevented by installing updates. Always make sure updates are legitimate—only install those that come directly from the vendor.</p>\n<p>Make sure your information is well defended. The internet is a minefield—malware and malicious code hide all over websites and in seemingly safe downloads. To help mitigate these risks, use a firewall and have an IT professional maintain your systems and computers. Be sure to hire someone who is familiar with church software and cyber security.</p>\n<p>Train staff and volunteers. One of the most important things you can do to protect your data is to train staff and volunteers on what they need to do to help prevent cyber-attacks. Establish policies and guidelines for computer and internet use in the office and be sure everyone is aware of these policies. And make sure you pick the best people to work with your church’s sensitive information—background checks can help you eliminate applicants who may have a history of data theft or other criminal activity.</p>\n<p>Develop a response plan. It’s essential to create a plan for how your church would respond to a data breach, just like any other element of disaster preparation. Detail the steps you will take in the event of a breach and designate a response team with specific roles for each member. Consider working with an attorney or legal team to ensure that your plan meets the requirements of <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/security-breach-notification-laws.aspx\">state and federal laws</a>.</p>\n<p>In the event of a data breach, there are several steps an organization should take.</p>\n<p>- Collect and organize evidence. Be sure to document all efforts to investigate and mitigate a breach. Seek advice from legal counsel on the best methods for organizing the evidence.<br />\n- Take action to reduce the impact. Determine what data, devices, and systems have been affected, and secure the devices, preserving any data that has been compromised. Change passwords immediately to prevent the attacker from continued access to your information.<br />\n- Notify members who have been affected. If information is exposed, the owners of that data must be notified. Each state has different laws about notifying those who are affected, so be sure to speak with legal counsel about the timeframe and content of the announcement.<br />\n- Review your response. After a data breach has been contained, take time to determine the effectiveness of your church’s response and how you can improve your cyber security measures and response plan.</p>\n<p>Just as washing your hands does not completely eliminate the possibility of contracting an illness, implementing cyber security measures won’t guarantee that your ministry will not experience a data breach. But practicing cyber security can help your church reduce the risk of such an event and be prepared if information is compromised.</p>\n<p>For more information on church risk management, check out our risk management resources <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/insurance/risk-management/resources/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>This information is not legal advice.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p><em>A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.</em><strong> <br /></strong><strong>Proverbs 11:25<br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>During this time of national and worldwide crisis and pandemic, we are thankful to be able to share a positive message. Generosity levels have increased significantly during this period, as people are using their resources to help others locally, nationally, and around the world.</p>\n<p>Fueled by the COVID-19 outbreak, social issues, and the rapid increase in unemployment, giving levels in the US have set new records. And in an effort to encourage charitable giving, as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed by Congress, the amount of cash contributions that could be taken as a tax deduction was expanded.</p>\n<p>Following those same trends, AG Foundation has also witnessed donors giving at a rate that is nearly doubled compared to this same time period in 2019. Unlike traditional foundations to which donors give money directly to support a specific cause, AG Foundation uses a unique conduit structure whereby donors are able to direct their giving <strong>through</strong> the foundation to the ministries or charities of their choosing.</p>\n<p>One of the more popular giving tools that can be used to make gifts is a <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/services/individual-services/individual-planned-giving/donor-advised-funds\">Donor Advised Fund </a>(DAF), often referred to as a “giving fund.” This giving fund gives the donor freedom to make a gift to their DAF and receive an immediate charitable tax deduction and then the donor can request grants to be made to a charity at any time in the future. Funding can be made with cash, as well as appreciated assets such as stock and real estate. A DAF, as well as some of our other products such as <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/services/individual-services/individual-planned-giving/charitable-gift-annuities\">Charitable Gift Annuities</a> (CGA) and <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/services/individual-services/individual-planned-giving/charitable-trusts\">Charitable Remainder Trusts</a> (CRT), can be customized to meet the specific needs and desires of the donor. These products provide the donor not only with tax deductions, but in some cases, the avoidance of capital gains on gifts of appreciated assets, and, based on the type of product used (CGA or CRT), fixed payments for life. Additionally, these products provide the donor the ability to select which ministries and charities they want to support such as food banks, elder care, missions, local churches, disaster relief, and many more both at the local and national level. </p>\n<p>To learn more about charitable giving and how you can help build the Kingdom while receiving benefits for yourself, <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/services/individual-services/individual-planned-giving\">click here</a>. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.candid.org/post/philanthropys-response-to-covid-19-now-more-than-10-billion-worldwide/\"></a></p>\n<p><strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <h2>Part 1: Price Increases</h2>\n<p>As part one of a three-part series covering church construction pitfalls, we will address the escalating issue of price increases and how they can be detrimental to a church project. Shawn Fink, Church Loan Consultant, and Brad Gillam, Construction Loan Manager, weigh in to provide professional insights on the topic.</p>\n<p>Unexpected price increases are a major issue for churches financing a construction project. Frequently, a contractor’s actual bid is significantly higher than the original estimate. If a church receives a loan based on the initial estimate, it may not have enough funds to complete the project. Or, if the loan was approved at the amount estimated, but the actual bid comes in considerably higher, the church may not qualify for the increased amount.</p>\n<p>“Going from estimate to bid is when the cost increase can happen due to many factors, such as city code compliance issues, increased cost of building materials due to potential trade tariffs, and a tightening labor market,” explains Shawn. “The current market is a feeding frenzy among contractors.” “Contractor prices,” says Shawn, “are inflated due to high demand. In most cases, it’s more cost efficient to buy an existing building and do basic renovations compared to new construction.”</p>\n<p>To safeguard your church from a situation in which the loan will not cover the entire construction project, Brad also suggests being wary of “cost-plus” contracts, which are bids based on whatever the project ends up costing, plus a contractor fee, typically around 10%. “I’d like to stress the importance of obtaining a guaranteed max price (GMP) contract. Without a maximum price, the church is leaving the project open-ended, and if there are unforeseen cost increases, the church will be responsible for paying them.” A hybrid option, which several churches use, is a cost-plus contract with a GMP in place. This provides a safety net with pricing but also provides the church the ability to see all associated construction costs – a benefit common to cost-plus contracts. Regardless of the contract type, be on the lookout for “escalation cost protection” and other additions to the contract that may cause the church to be liable for increased costs and not the builder.</p>\n<p>With so many factors to consider and potential pitfalls during the construction process, it helps to have wise counsel and a partner that understands the process. Brad said, “One of the things pastors appreciate about AGFinancial is that they receive a lot of value with their church loan. In addition to the financing, they’re able to save time and money with our construction consultation. It’s exciting to see how we’ve helped so many churches navigate the process and avoid unnecessary cost increases.”</p>\n<p>“Let me also address the idea of financially planning for a large project,” Shawn said. He encourages churches to start building cash reserves for a construction project as early as five years out. In addition to setting aside cash, Shawn also recommends sharing the vision for the project and raising additional funds internally. Shawn’s advice to churches is to determine the total source of funds (money you have, can raise, and can borrow) and debt capacity, then begin the capital campaign before securing a loan or consulting an architect. “Don’t commit to a project cost if you don’t have the money in your pocket or the ability to service a mortgage payment,” advises Shawn.</p>\n<p>When asked about timing the start of a project based on potentially lower labor and material costs, Shawn mentioned that it could help, but ultimately, “when the Lord says step out of the boat, it’s time to step out of the boat.”</p>\n<p>For more resources on church construction, get our <a href=\"http://files.agfinancial.org/Loans/WHITE-PAPERS-ChurchConstruction.pdf\">Church Construction 101</a> white paper.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/pitfalls-to-avoid-when-considering-church-construction-part-2-source-and-use/\">Click here</a> to read Part 2 of this series where we cover source and use.</p>\n<p>Fill out this brief inquiry <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/church-loans/loan-inquiry/\">form</a> to learn more from a loan consultant in your area, or contact us at 888.599.6015 or loans@agfinancial.org.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <h2>Part 2: Source and Use</h2>\n<p>In this second installment of this three-part series on church construction, we are stressing the importance of planning for a project that fits your budget. To help with this topic, Shawn Fink, Church Loan Consultant, will share his experience.</p>\n<p>Often, lenders and others will refer to “source and use” as it relates to a project and budget. “Source” is simply the source(s) of funding for a project, and “use” is the cost of the project itself. The big idea here is that in planning a project, you should determine your sources of funding and anticipated total amount available, and plan your project so that it stays within that amount.</p>\n<p>Typically, there are three sources of funding for a church project; money you have, money you raise, and money you borrow. Unfortunately, most churches don’t consider financial preparation for a project until it’s time to actually start construction, but Shawn encourages, “Having cash reserves on the front end gives you mobility to do everything from feasibility studies, to project planning and schematic drawings that can assist with project estimating all before you have committed yourself to anything.” Although most churches do not want to start raising money prior to a project, Shawn shared that it can make the process of planning for and defining a project much smoother, and helps ensure that your source and use align as you cast vision for the future. To learn more about casting vision for a building project, check out our white paper on “<a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/cultivating-generous-givers/\">Cultivating Generous Givers</a>.”</p>\n<p>As you are considering the use, start working on figuring out the source. Most churches are naturally forced to start thinking about a project because of growing ministries and facilities needs. Consideration of your source of funding may need more intentionality.</p>\n<p>Shawn states, “The pre-planning stage and consideration of source and use is critical. Many churches make the mistake of spending thousands of dollars and significant time designing plans for a project, only to find that they cannot afford it once they find out how much it would cost. Churches should start the process of determining source and use simultaneously so that the cost of the project meets the affordability.”</p>\n<p>“A loan is often required in order to complete a church construction project, so one of the first things we encourage churches to do is determine their debt capacity. That doesn’t mean the church should borrow to the maximum of what a lender would allow, but knowing that threshold is good data to have when trying to determine your total source.”</p>\n<p>In Part 3 of this series, we will cover the importance of choosing the right lender for your church. When you find a lender that comes alongside your church as a partner that believes in your vision, it makes all the difference.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/pitfalls-to-avoid-when-considered-church-construction-pt-1\">Click here</a> to read Part 1 of this series where we covered price increases and how they could affect your church construction project.</p>\n<p>Fill out this brief inquiry form to learn more from a loan consultant in your area, or contact us at 888.599.6015 or <a href=\"mailto:loans@agfinancial.org\">loans@agfinancial.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

Click <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/pitfalls-to-avoid-when-considering-church-construction-part-2-source-and-use/\">here</a> to learn more. Now to close this series, we will be discussing the importance of choosing the right lender. To help us with this topic we once again speak with Shawn Fink, Church Loan Consultant, and Brad Gillam, Construction Loan Manager.</p>\n<p>Finding a lender can be overwhelming. There are many different types of financial institutions to choose from, and not all will fit your church’s individual needs. Be sure to research each option to determine which will best serve your church. Also, keep in mind how the lending institution would utilize your funds. Unfortunately, quite a few national lenders may utilize interest income to support corporate causes that may not line up with your Christian values. You can continue being good stewards of the money entrusted to your church by being diligent in choosing a lender whose values align with yours.</p>\n<p>When you work with AGFinancial, you get more than a lender—you get a partner that understands ministry. Brad shares, “We work to make sure the church has help in every stage of their project, not just in obtaining the loan.”</p>\n<p>Shawn Fink explains that the role of the AGFinancial loan consultant is to walk a pastor through the process. He takes the time to understand the church’s finances from a ministry-first perspective and ultimately determines the best financing strategy for a church based not only on the numbers, but also the church’s unique situation and God-given vision. He states, “Often, banks will look first at their own needs and quotas, and select borrowers that fit in their box, sometimes basing affordability on income the church never intended for debt service.”</p>\n<p>Regardless of who you choose, make sure to partner with a lender that understands the unique needs of ministry, the ebbs and flows of church business, and how to support church growth.</p>\n<p>We hope this series has been beneficial in the planning process for your church construction project.</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, check out <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/pitfalls-to-avoid-when-considered-church-construction-pt-1/\">part 1</a> on price increases and <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/pitfalls-to-avoid-when-considering-church-construction-part-2-source-and-use/\">part 2</a> on source and use.</p>\n<p>Fill out this brief inquiry <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/church-loans/loan-inquiry/\">form</a> to learn more from a loan consultant in your area, or contact us at 888.599.6015 or <a href=\"mailto:loans@agfinancial.org\">loans@agfinancial.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p><strong>Investing with Your Emotions.</strong></p>\n<p>In this first of a 3-part series, we sat down with Kyle Dana, AGFinancial’ Senior Vice President, Retirement and Investments, to hear his insights and answers to questions regarding investing.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Kyle, when is the best time to get into the market?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The market has now entered its eighth year as a bull market (a confident market for which an indicator is rising share prices), the second longest bull market in history. Since the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, the S&amp;P 500 has increased nearly <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/09/investing/bull-market-anniversary-8-year/index.html\">250%</a>. This steep incline of growth has lulled many into what could prove to be a false sense of security.</p>\n<p>Investors are human, which means that they are emotional and constantly changing. They tend to sell when the market is low because of the emotional response to seeing losses reflected on their statements or reported bad news in the media. Similarly, investors often want to move their money back in <strong>after</strong> the market has had a significant increase.</p>\n<p>I read once that the stock market is the most unusual market in the world, because when everything is on sale, no one wants to buy. An analogy of this mentality is buying your clothes only when the prices are raised and returning them after they go on clearance—for the lower sale price.</p>\n<p>Selling at market lows can devastate your portfolio’s performance. At the same time, buying at higher prices can be equally devastating. A successful investor once said, “Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful.” This is just another way of stating the old adage, “Buy low, sell high.”</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Based on what you just said, how much of a role do emotions play in investing?</strong></p>\n<p>A: In general, emotions are a major driver of our daily decisions. The same is true when people make investment decisions. The more investors can understand that, and balance emotion with logical decision making, the more successful they will be.</p>\n<p>In this bull market, I often hear people say that they feel like they’re missing out by not investing more heavily in the market. It’s important to realize that it’s that feeling of missing out that drives people to change their portfolio to something more aggressive than their normal risk tolerance level would allow. That’s illustrated by the fact that when the market goes down, they immediately bail. That unfortunate behavior means they were invested in something too aggressive for their comfort level. An investment with the potential to earn 10-15% most likely also has the potential to lose the same or greater.</p>\n<p>A perfect example is a person that I recently spoke to who was seeking higher returns. During our phone call, he informed me that in late 2008 he had moved out of the market at lows. In doing this, he locked in a significant loss.</p>\n<p>Now he was asking the question, “When is the appropriate time for me to move back into the market?” My response was simple…I am not a market timer, however, my personal experience has been that the best time to get in is when you feel least comfortable getting in.</p>\n<p>I told him that past behavior is a strong indicator of future behavior, so if he got in at highs and bailed at lows before, it sounds like he was on the path to repeat again. But this time he is 10 years older and closer to retirement.</p>\n<p>FINAL THOUGHT: Consider how close you are to retirement. Be extra careful when thinking about reallocating your investments.</p>\n<p><strong>If you’re an <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/403b/\">AG 403(b)</a> investor, familiarize yourself with the investment options available within the plan.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Have you heard of <em>Lifestyle Inflation</em>? If you have not heard this phrase, you probably know the feeling. Some may call it “keeping up with the Joneses,” but it’s the idea of increasing spending as more money becomes available (for example a raise or inheritance). A better plan for extra money would be to consider building your financial security.</p>\n<p>One approach is to adopt the 80/10/10 method. This means that 80% of your budget is spent on your fixed and variable expenses, 10% goes to savings, and 10% is allocated for your tithe. It’s important to live within your means, and living on 80% of your income allows you to do this. In addition, the 10% that goes to savings can be used in many areas – creating an <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/cash-reserves-much-emergency-fund-need/\">emergency fund</a>, <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/cash-reserves-much-emergency-fund-need/\">building cash reserves</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/boost-retirement-savings/\">saving for retirement</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re already living an 80/10/10 lifestyle and you see your income increase, you may have the ability to increase your personal spending while also increasing the amount you save. It’s like having the best of both worlds. Of course, if your retirement account needs attention, and you don’t have an emergency fund established, we recommend those areas be prioritized.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we recommend that you do not lump your emergency fund with existing checking or savings accounts. It’s best to park it separately so that you don’t accidentally (or intentionally) use those funds for purposes other than emergencies. Also, consider placing the money where you can earn interest, allowing the value to increase over time, like an <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/investments/\">AGFinancial Demand Certificate</a>.</p>\n<p>To learn more about managing your finances, we recommend the following articles:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/5-ways-declutter-finances/\">5 Ways to Declutter Your Finances</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/52-ways-to-save-ebook/\">52 Ways to Save</a></p>\n<p><em>This is not an offering to sell securities referred to herein and we are not soliciting you to purchase these securities.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Summer is here—a time of vacations, swimming, and fun in the sun. Many churches and districts also host annual summer camps for both children and teenagers. These camps are a fantastic outreach opportunity, but they also present possible risks.</p>\n<p>With water sports, outdoor activities, and a crowd of people of varying ages, the potential for injury or incident is significant. But with risk management, you can help prepare your camp for the unexpected. Here are simple tips on checking the facilities, avoiding injury, and protecting children from sexual abuse.</p>\n<h3>Check the Facilities</h3>\n<p>Just taking the time to thoroughly examine your facilities and grounds can help you minimize or eliminate common dangers.<br />\nHere are a few things you should look for during your camp walkthrough:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any hazard that could cause someone to trip or fall, such as loose carpet or cords stretched across walking areas</li>\n<li>Sufficient lighting, handrails, steps that are resistant to slips</li>\n<li>Emergency exits – clearly marked, well lit, and free of obstruction</li>\n<li>Damage to buildings or other structures that could cause accidents or injuries</li>\n<li>Inspect heating and ventilation systems, as well as any appliances</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Avoiding Injury</h3>\n<p>Be sure you have a release form on file for each camper, documenting both parental permission and the activities in which they are allowed to participate. The form should include emergency contact information, a list of medications and allergies, and a release authorizing medical care should the camper be injured.</p>\n<p>A few summer camp staples with tips to avoid accidents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Campfires: gasoline should not be used, don’t allow paint or aerosol nearby, and set a proper safe zone</li>\n<li>Golf carts and ATVs: create a rule that no one under 18 years of age is permitted to drive one of these vehicles and drivers should not have any passengers</li>\n<li>Water activities: pay attention to the weather, be aware of every camper’s swimming ability, have a CPR-certified lifeguard at all times</li>\n<li>Inflatables: make sure the camp leaders know and follow the manufacturer’s instructions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your camp has a blob or iceberg-style inflatable, be sure to take the following precautions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Require all participants to wear life jackets</li>\n<li>Instruct jumpers to start in a seated position and to land on their rear ends</li>\n<li>Make sure the area is clear before allowing the next participant to jump</li>\n<li>Ensure that two lifeguards are always present – one on the platform and one in the water in a canoe or kayak</li>\n<li>Be sure that lifeguards have 360-degree visibility around the area</li>\n<li>Do not allow anyone to swim beneath the blob</li>\n<li>Post rules in a prominent area</li>\n<li>Create a barrier to prevent access to an unsupervised blob</li>\n<li>There are many items that could potentially cause injury, but being aware of these main issues could greatly decrease the number of accidents at your camp. An extra tip is to have swimmers wear colored armbands to be aware of each camper’s swimming ability. <a href=\"https://www.churchmutual.com/107/Swimmer-Safety-Progrgam-is-valuable,-life-saving-tool\">Church Mutual</a> offers the bands free of charge to customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Protecting Children from Sexual Abuse</h3>\n<p>Sexual misconduct with minors is the primary reason that churches end up in court. Fortunately, there are several ways to minimize the potential of an incident happening, as well as the ministry’s liability. A smart rule for camps is the “6/2” rule. This rule requires adult volunteers must have been church members for at least six months, and a minor should never be alone with just one adult. Check out this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHkthLUZyAY\">video</a> highlighting 10 steps churches can take to help protect against child abuse occurrences.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When preparing for summer camp, safety is our priority. Protecting my students from danger, risk or injury sets them up for success during the camp week to experience everything God has for them! - Aaron Edwards, Hope Church’s Student Pastor</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mission Assure, a product of AGFinancial Insurance Solutions, offers superior short-term protection for camps and other church events and outings.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>True financial planning involves both short-term and long-term goals. Most people are able to create and often meet short-term goals, but long-term goals may not come as easy. They require more thinking, looking at the future, and planning for a time that may feel far down the road. To help navigate this process, we’ve provided four pillars to financial planning.</p>\n<h2>Emergency Fund</h2>\n<p>Did you know that according to a <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2017-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201805.pdf\">2018 report</a> by the Federal Reserve only 59% of Americans could cover an unexpected $400 emergency expense? An emergency fund does more than provide the funds when an unexpected expense arises, it also provides peace of mind and is the first line of defense against incurring debt. Minimize the temptation to dip into this fund by separating it from the account you use for monthly expenses. Click here to learn how <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/investments/\">AGFinancial</a> provides competitive rates while also benefitting ministry growth.</p>\n<h2>Retirement Savings</h2>\n<p>After your emergency fund is in place, think about your future. Saving for your financial future needs to be a priority, using a qualified employer plan (401(k) or <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/403b/\">403(b)</a>) and/or <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/investments/ira/\">IRA</a>s. And the longer you wait, the harder it will be to reach your <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/know-your-numbers/\">retirement savings goal</a>. Click <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/do-these-5-things-now/\">here</a> to read the 5 easy steps to take now to grow your retirement savings.</p>\n<h2>Adequate Insurance</h2>\n<p>Along with planning for your future, make sure you are protecting your family and your assets by obtaining appropriate insurance coverage. <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/insurance/life/\">Life insurance</a>, although it’s something we often do not want to think about, is crucial to protect and take care of those you love in the event something happens to you. <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/insurance/personal-lines-insurance/\">Personal lines insurance</a> is also important to make sure you have adequate coverage for your car, house, and other belongings. Make insurance a priority as it can help protect you and your family from possible financial devastation in the event of an unforeseen event.</p>\n<h2>Estate Planning</h2>\n<p>An important part of a financial plan that is often overlooked is how you can affect others with your finances both now and after you pass on. The simplest way to be prepared is to have a will to determine how your assets will be distributed. However, there are other <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/planned-giving/ag-foundation/\">benefits to planned giving</a> such as generating income for you and your family, receiving potential tax benefits, and supporting the ministries of your choice.</p>\n<h2>What’s Next?</h2>\n<p>Keep in mind this is not the end-all-be-all of finances, but a foundation to start you on the right track. It is beneficial at every stage of your life to take a step back and make sure the decisions you are making today are lined up with the future you want for yourself.</p>\n<p>We encourage you to look at your finances from a fresh perspective. Do you know what financial success looks like for you? Are you on track to accomplish the financial goals you have set for yourself? Are you doing what you can to protect your financial future? Have you considered what kind of legacy you want to leave behind? If not, what steps can you begin to take now that will move you closer to your goals?</p>\n<p>With products that meet a variety of financial needs, we want to partner with you to help you succeed.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 increased the charitable giving deduction to 60 percent of adjusted gross income (AGI), up from the 50 percent of AGI that has been in place for many years. </p>\n<p>The 2023 standard deduction for married couples has now been nearly doubled to $27,700. Married taxpayers may also bump up their standard deduction by $1,500 per spouse (or $1,850 per unmarried individual) if age 65 or older or blind. Many other commonly used deductions have been reduced. These changes lower the number of taxpayers who can itemize tax deductions.</p>\n<p>By reducing itemized deductions, more givers will be pushed into using the standard deduction. Why does this matter? Claiming the standard deduction will negate any tax benefit related to charitable giving. The challenge for givers who typically itemize will be getting past that $27,700 standard deduction threshold.</p>\n<p>Diligent givers who also want the benefit of the maximum charitable tax deduction will need to plan ahead to get over the $27,700 standard deduction hump. If their deductions are less than $27,700, they will receive no additional tax benefit for their giving.</p>\n<p>Imagine Jim and Sally, a married couple (filing jointly) who typically itemize $23,000 of deductions per year. They will not qualify for the 60% charitable deduction. If $10,000 of their deductions is related to charitable giving and $13,000 of their deductions are non-charitable, what can they do to improve their tax situation?</p>\n<p>Jim and Sally can use a two-year strategy called “bunching”. In year one, give $20,000 into a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) with AG Foundation. Yes, that is twice their typical annual giving, but those funds can be distributed out of the DAF to their favorite ministries over two calendar years.</p>\n<p>Calculating their $20,000 giving with their $13,000 of non-charitable deductions, Jim and Sally now have $33,000 in deductions in year one. They have overcome the standard deduction amount of $27,700, allowing them to gain access to the 60% charitable deduction and reduce their taxes.</p>\n<p>In year two, if Jim and Sally choose not to contribute to their DAF, they will simply use the $27,700 standard deduction. Jim and Sally will have benefited with a lower overall tax bill in those two years. But why stop there?</p>\n<p>Jim and Sally are diligent givers. If they annually continue this $20,000 pattern of giving, they can claim charitable deductions at the 60% rate year over year. Their DAF will earn income on funds not immediately distributed. Jim and Sally can direct funds to ministries over time as God shows them where their giving will have the greatest impact to further the Kingdom.</p>\n<p>Jim and Sally could also benefit by donating appreciated investments and assets to the DAF. Giving appreciated assets adds a second advantage. When the DAF sells appreciated assets, Jim and Sally will not owe capital gains tax. Their giving impact would be reduced by 15-20% if they sold those appreciated assets outright. By using the DAF, they can give away 100% of the sales proceeds over time.</p>\n<p>Contact us to learn more about how to maximize the tax advantages of charitable giving.</p>\n<p><em>This information is not tax advice and is for illustration purposes only.

For additional ideas, click <a href=\"https://media.agfinancial.org/52-Ways-To-Save-AGFS-eBook_200619_074410.pdf?mtime=20200619004409&focal=none\">here</a> to read 52 Ways to Save.</p>\n<p>2) Reconsider your risk tolerance and your investments. Are you able to invest more aggressively for the opportunity of greater returns? What percent of your retirement savings are you content with having in more stable, low return investments? This is a very personal area of finance and you need to understand your risk tolerance; click <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/biggest-mistakes-investors-make-part-3/\">here</a> to learn more.</p>\n<p>3) Be careful of financial predators. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Question how someone can guarantee an income or investment rate in the current economy. Beware if you are encouraged to move all your savings to a product like an insurance annuity or investment strategy; diversification is a valuable tool that helps lower risk and weather changes in the market. You will also want to be aware of the role commissions may play; is this decision in your best interests or theirs? Don’t be so scared that you don’t have enough saved for retirement that you become a victim of a scam. Always speak to an independent financial advisor before making big investment decisions.</p>\n<p>4) Recognize that you may need extra time before you are able to retire. If you are saving all you can, willingness to work a little bit longer may be your best friend. Not only will additional time allow you to save more, it allows for additional potential growth of your savings. You might just need to move your projected retirement date a few years forward. Or consider phasing into retirement by moving to part-time rather than full time employment. Consider working as a consultant in your field of expertise. There’s no rule that says retirement has to be 100% or nothing.</p>\n<p>Your retirement is just that—your retirement. It may not look like the retirement of your parents or grandparents. Know what retirement looks like to you. Know what you want, and know what you are saving to achieve. And go for it.</p>\n<p>Save as if your future depends on you.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>We live in a time where things can quickly be deemed bad or unhealthy, and the news spreads like wildfire with opinions on social media. Often, people make decisions based on emotions and what people are saying around them. While seeking counsel is wise, understanding all the facts for yourself is also a smart choice.</p>\n<p>When it comes to debt, we have gravitated towards the perception that all debt is bad. Chris Railey, former Senior Director of Leadership and Church Development for the Assemblies of God and current role as Sr./Lead pastor of The Oaks Church, calls it the Dave Ramsey Effect. In a recent article written for church leaders, he noted, “A debt-averse culture has led to less investments in education, partnerships, and building projects.” His observation is spot-on.</p>\n<p>Churches were made to grow and expand in reaching communities for Christ, and sometimes the plan for strategic growth requires financing. The concern is that many pastors are hesitant to leverage debt in accomplishing growth goals, when financing may actually be the right tool.</p>\n<p>Before we go any further, let’s break down the definitions of good debt and bad debt.</p>\n<p>Good debt is an investment that will grow in value or generate a return or desired result. The investment community refers to it as leverage – allowing one to increase their return by using debt to invest in a larger asset than one’s cash on hand would allow. For instance, financing the expansion of church facilities can be good debt, as it accommodates growth and increases the value of an appreciating asset – the property. The return on the investment can be both financial, with more tithes/offerings, and eternal, with a greater harvest for the kingdom of God.</p>\n<p>Bad debt can be defined as debt incurred to purchase things that quickly lose value with little to no return. There are many items in the church world where debt should not be used. For instance, items with a short shelf life (like food products) or even furnishings within the church should be purchased with cash when possible. Make sure to budget for these items. If you know of larger expenses coming in the future, you may have time to grow your church’s cash reserves or raise the funds internally to cover the costs.</p>\n<p>If your church is growing and you decide to pursue financing to accomplish your ministry vision, make sure only to take on enough financing to meet the need while staying within the church’s ability to service the debt.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Planning an international mission trip can be a challenge. With flights, customs, and security concerns, there’s so much to keep in mind when traveling overseas, especially with a group. The last thing anyone planning an international trip wants to think about is the possibility of an accident or medical emergency. But a little forethought and preparation can help you and your team focus on ministry, instead of worrying about the potential of sickness or accident.</p>\n<p>There are numerous things you can do to increase the security of your mission team. An emergency ID kit can be essential in the event of a lost or stolen passport and is simple to put together. Make a photocopy of the data page of your passport and write down the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. embassies and consulates in the countries you plan to visit. Place this information, as well as two recent passport photos, somewhere separate from your passport.</p>\n<p>If the option is available, book non-stop flights to increase security and avoid delays. Be sure to leave a copy of your travel itinerary with family or a secretary or assistant; someone at home should always know your schedule when you’re out of the country.</p>\n<p>Make sure to see your doctor six to eight weeks before your trip to ensure that you have all the necessary vaccinations and are aware of any potential health issues that may affect your travel abroad. If you take any prescribed medications, make sure that you have enough for an extended stay, as well as a copy of your prescription.</p>\n<p>When it comes to being safe in a foreign country, a good practice is to maintain a low profile. Don’t dress loudly or in a way that would draw attention and avoid wearing any valuable jewelry or watches. When making purchases, avoid displaying credit cards or large amounts of cash.</p>\n<p>Know the location of the U.S. Embassy and find out what services or advice the officials there can provide. Listen to local advice from guides about which areas are safe and which to avoid. If you find yourself in an area where you feel unsafe, walk quickly but not hurriedly and try to appear as if you know where you’re going.</p>\n<p>Medical treatment in other countries is not always comparable to that at home. A variety of circumstances, such as a lack of proper tools and medications, could quickly turn a simple illness into a life-threatening situation. If your team is in a remote area, suitable medical facilities may not be available, requiring transport by ambulance or helicopter, which can lead to even greater expense.</p>\n<p>While some insurance companies may provide coverage for international medical care, it is generally very limited and may only cover injury, not illness, and most policies do not provide coverage for general liability or automobile coverage if your church is sued due to an accident.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, many travelers are unaware that most domestic insurance coverage does not apply in foreign countries. As a result, many mission teams don’t have the insurance coverage they need to protect them from accidents, medical emergencies, or lawsuits that could occur during their travels. That’s why short-term travel insurance can be invaluable during a mission trip.</p>\n<p>Like all types of insurance, travel insurance is something you hope you never have to use. However, short-term insurance for mission trips offers a safety net if the unexpected happens.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.agfinancial.org/insurance/mission-assure/\">Mission Assure</a>, a product provided by AGFinancial Insurance Solutions, provides short-term insurance at an affordable price. Unlike other travel insurance programs that require large premiums, the Mission Assure policy offers full coverage for a low per-person, per-day premium. At just $2.50 per day for domestic travelers and $4.50 per day for foreign travelers, Mission Assure is an affordable alternative to high-premium travel insurance programs. We are able to offer this preferred pricing because it is part of the larger Assemblies of God travel insurance program.</p>\n<p>For more information about Mission Assure, click <a href=\"http://www.agfinancial.org/insurance/mission-assure/\">here</a> or contact AGFinancial Insurance Solutions at 866.890.0156 or missionassure@agfinancial.org.</p>\n<p>Click <a href=\"http://www.agfinancial.org/insurance/risk-management/resources/\">here</a> to view our Risk Management Resources to learn more about how you can protect your ministry.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "excerpt": "Is your church financially fit?",
    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Is your church financially fit?</p>\n<p>Part of being a good steward is taking care of the resources God has given you and using them to further the Kingdom. As a leader of your church and congregation, you have a responsibility to help ensure that your members’ funds are being used properly and to set an example of good financial practices.</p>\n<p>To create and maintain a solid financial foundation, a church needs strong financial leadership, both in the office and on the church board. A few board members with backgrounds in finance can be a valuable resource when you’re planning the annual church budget.</p>\n<p>And when it comes to budgets, “You can’t manage what you don’t measure,” says Brent Olson, Senior Vice President of Finance at AGFinancial. Planning a budget is more than a matter of assigning funds for each ministry and activity. It requires careful and thoughtful planning, as well as regular review and management.</p>\n<p>A budget details how your ministry uses its funds to fulfill its mission and vision. When developing or adjusting your budget, review each line item and consider eliminating anything that doesn’t help your church reach its goals.</p>\n<p>Your church leadership should meet regularly to review the budget and current financial activity. Compare your budget to how much money is actually going out and coming in. If you’re not aware of where you are financially, it’s hard to know where you’re going and whether your finances are on the right track.</p>\n<p>A great way to monitor your finances is to include two columns in your financial reports: one for actual spending and one for budgeted spending. Seeing where you’re exceeding or falling short can help you better plan for the future. For more practical tips on church budgets, including a free template download, check out our <a href=\"http://www.agfinancial.org/church-finance-ebook/\"><em>Church Finance Guide</em></a></p>\n<p>As you build your church budget, review expenses and spending for previous years. If you budget to 90% of the previous year’s budget, you’ll have 10% to direct toward cash reserves or to cover any unexpected expenses that may crop up throughout the year. Building this margin into the budget allows your church to steadily grow its savings and prepare for unplanned expenses.</p>\n<p>Keeping your church financially healthy can also involve helping out your members. Consider offering financial counseling services to help your congregants get their finances on track. Many people want to give to ministry but simply lack the funds to do so. If you help your church members take control of their finances, they’ll be able to give more freely to Kingdom work.</p>\n<p>A financially healthy church can serve as a demonstration and inspiration to its members. If your church can manage its finances well and reach the community, your congregants will have a clear example of good financial stewardship, and your ministry will have more impact on the community it seeks to reach.</p>\n<p>To learn more about to create a culture of giving in your church, <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/cultivating-generous-givers/\">download</a> our free white paper, <em>Cultivating Generous Givers</em>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "excerpt": "A church experiencing growth is an exciting and awesome thing, but expanding your facilities to meet your ministry’s needs can be a challenge.",
    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>A church experiencing growth is an exciting and awesome thing, but expanding your facilities to meet your ministry’s needs can be a challenge.</p>\n<p>We spoke to Josh Brannon, Executive Director of Operations at Gateway Fellowship Church in San Antonio, Texas, about their church expansion process and what he’s learned along the way.</p>\n<p>Gateway recently celebrated its tenth anniversary. What began as eight people meeting in a living room has grown into a thriving church family. From that small gathering, the church held services in a middle school and then a movie theater before moving into its current building in 2015. At the time they left the theater, Gateway welcomed around 750 people each weekend, and once they moved into their building, they saw continued growth, hosting three-and sometimes even four-services.</p>\n<p>“Through the wisdom of our Advisory Council and pastors,” Brannon said, “they began planning for growth while the church was growing, as opposed to waiting until that growth had plateaued.”</p>\n<p>Even as Gateway’s new building was being designed and constructed, the church’s leadership were considering the next phases of expansion.</p>\n<p>“There was always a desire and a hope to one day maximize the land God had given us,” Brannon said.</p>\n<p>The goal for the construction project was mission-focused: “To make room for more friends in the community to further our mission of helping our friends become devoted followers of Jesus.”</p>\n<p>“We try to remain laser-focused on that mission,” Brannon said, “and never stray from that goal.”</p>\n<p>Outside of the broader goal, there were some non-negotiable aspects of the design, such as the number of seats in the auditorium, parking areas, and rooms for children’s ministry. But many other design elements changed as the project went on.</p>\n<p>Although the multiple phased planned for by the church leadership were scheduled with several years in between, the surge in growth following the initial move in the first building caused the church to accelerate their Phase 2 plans by two years.</p>\n<p>Even though the Phase 2 expansion project was so close in time to the original construction of the building, Brannon said it was easy to see where certain decisions made in Phase 1 could have made the later phases of the project easier. However, Brannon added, you can only make decisions based on the information you have at the time. “The expansion project has provided an opportunity to address aspects that were either not included in the initial build or not optimally designed because of budget constraints or unknowns.”</p>\n<p>Brannon said that he would recommend spending as much time as possible during the design phase, not only with the designer, architect, and engineers, but also with church staff and volunteers who are familiar with how specific areas of the facility function.</p>\n<p>“Allow different groups to speak into the design early on,” Brannon said. “Finalize as much as you can early in the design process. The more work that you can put in on the front end to finalize the design, the less work you should have on the back end, trying to fine-tune design elements.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Brannon urged any pastors considering a construction or expansion project to rely on the expertise of the professionals they hire, but not hesitate to ask questions or set high expectations. Taking the time to have the design thoroughly explained at the beginning of the process can save confusion and headaches later.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be afraid to question the different costs and aspects of the project,” Brannon said. “It’s essential to have a thorough understanding of everything and to be aware of any available alternatives.”</p>\n<p>For more information on Gateway Fellowship’s expansion process, check out <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jnFut9DcWOU\">this video</a> with Pastor John Van Pay.</p>\n<p>Thinking about expanding your facilities?

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>God has called us to be good stewards of those things with which He has entrusted us. That includes everything from taking care of our families, to being responsible for our planet, to investing and using our money wisely.</p>\n<p>Wise financial management is especially important for pastors and church leaders who oversee the hard-earned contributions of their congregants. From savings and investments to church loans, choosing the right financial partners for your church should be done with thoughtful and prayerful consideration.</p>\n<p>Just like a personal mortgage, servicing debt is a significant part of a church’s operating budget—on average 20 to 30 percent. When compared to the average church missions giving of just five percent, the amount of money a church puts toward debt is a substantial portion of their annual budget. Wouldn’t it be good to know exactly where that money goes?</p>\n<p>When your church takes out a loan to construct a new building or expand your facilities, it’s important to thoroughly research the financial institution providing that loan. Unfortunately, many national lenders may use your congregants’ tithes and contributions to support causes that conflict with core Christian values.</p>\n<p>When you partner with AGFinancial to grow your ministry, you’re partnering with an organization whose values align with your own.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the 1,100-page Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This piece of legislation resulted in significant changes in U.S. tax law, many of which affect churches and ministers. In a recent video, Dr. Richard Hammar discussed some of the changes to the tax law and their implications. Below are his top three things you need to know about the new tax bill.</p>\n<p>1. Prohibition of Church Political Campaign Activity<br />\nThe first version of the bill provided that a church would not lose its exempt status because of any statement made in the course of the church’s regular activities. However, this provision did not end up in the final version of the law, so churches are still prohibited from participating in political campaign activity.</p>\n<p>2. Increase in the Standard Deduction<br />\nBoth married and single taxpayers will see a substantial increase in their standard deduction as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The deduction for married couples will increase from approximately $13,000 to $24,000, while single taxpayers will see their standard deduction increase from $6,500 to $12,000.</p>\n<p>3. Qualified Tuition Reduction Exclusion<br />\nMany churches operate schools and may offer tuition discounts to employees. In the past, these reductions have not been taxable, as long as certain conditions are met. Originally, the new law was going to repeal this tax benefit, but the tuition reduction exclusion was not repealed in the final version.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/XzMsfz9-Nhs\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here</a> to watch Dr. Richard Hammar’s video on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in which he discusses the top 10 major changes in the bill and their implications.</p>\n<p><em>This information is not legal or tax advice.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>During this time of year, we are often reminded of the importance of giving to others, especially those less fortunate. In fact, many charitable organizations receive a substantial amount of their donations near the end of the year, especially around the Christmas holiday. These year-end gifts not only help ministries and charitable organizations continue their work, but can also provide the donor with tax benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Find the Right Giving Vehicle</strong><br />\nWhen making last-minute gifts, timing is essential. You have until December 31 to make a charitable gift that will impact your taxes. A cash gift can be completed right at the end of the year, while gifts of appreciated stock and real estate usually require more time to complete. Fortunately, there are a variety of tools that can help you reach your personal giving goals.</p>\n<p>A <strong><a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/planned-giving/planned-giving-tools/donor-advised-funds/\">Donor Advised Fund</a></strong> is a convenient way to enjoy tax benefits now, while setting aside money to donate in the future. You contribute money to the fund, receive an immediate tax deduction, and then advise where and when the money should be distributed.</p>\n<p>A <strong><a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/planned-giving/planned-giving-tools/gift-annuities/\">Charitable Gift Annuity</a></strong> can provide a lifetime fixed income for you and/or others, as well as the opportunity to support ministry with the remainder. And if you fund a Gift Annuity you could receive an immediate tax deduction for the gift portion of the annuity.</p>\n<p>A <strong><a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/planned-giving/planned-giving-tools/charitable-remainder-trusts/\">Charitable Remainder Trust</a></strong> is designed to provide immediate tax benefits, income for you for a set period of time and the support of the ministry of your choice with the trust remainder. The funding of the trust creates an immediate tax deduction and the avoidance of capital gains on the sale of appreciated assets.</p>\n<p>An <strong><a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/planned-giving/planned-giving-tools/endowments-2/\">Endowment</a></strong> provides the ministry of your choice with ongoing support for an unlimited number of years, even after your lifetime. In addition, this giving tool provides continual payments, which are particularly ideal if you wish to continue to add assets to the fund, to provide ongoing support to a ministry, or to establish a scholarship.</p>\n<p>Regardless of your tax bracket, making charitable donations at the end of the year may benefit you when it’s time to fill out your tax return. Be sure to consult your tax advisor before making any significant charitable contributions, in order to understand the impact such a gift could have on your own taxes and finances.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in making a charitable gift or exploring your options for taking advantage of tax benefits, contact us today at 877.616.5205 or <a href=\"mailto:plannedgiving@agfinancial.org\">plannedgiving@agfinancial.org</a>.</p>\n<p><em>This information is not legal or tax advice.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>One third of all church congregations experience some form of theft or fraud each year. Fraud is an intentional deception made against an organization for personal gain, and it can go undetected for months or even years. <a href=\"http://www.sharefaith.com/blog/2015/09/18-church-embezzlement\">Church fraud</a> often takes place over a long period of time and involves stealing small sums intermittently, making it difficult to detect.</p>\n<p>Churches are often too trusting with members and employees, giving too much leeway and providing an opportunity for fraud to occur. Church leadership should take time to observe and question all financial information in order to strengthen internal controls.</p>\n<p>There are several signs of possible fraud for which church leadership should be on the lookout:<br />\n- A significant decrease in revenues<br />\n- An increase in expenses<br />\n- Missing documents and/or disorganized records<br />\n- An employee or volunteer who refuses to take time off<br />\n- Resistance to promotions or changes in responsibilities</p>\n<p>In order to protect both its finances and its reputation, the church should proactively develop<a href=\"https://youtu.be/oV3KdaoGmxY\"> internal controls</a> to prevent acts of fraud. Below are some examples of internal controls.</p>\n<p><strong>Divide financial duties and responsibilities.</strong> Make sure that different people are responsible for offering collection and counting, depositing funds, and reconciling statements. The person cutting checks should not be the same person approving checks and reconciling the bank statements.</p>\n<p><strong>Invest in annual CPA reviews or audits.</strong> These reviews can seem costly, but not detecting fraud can be far more detrimental to your organization.</p>\n<p><strong>Have a written financial policy</strong> and make sure all employees or volunteers involved with church funds are aware of the proper procedures for handling money. In addition, conduct background checks and credit reports on all persons handling church funds.</p>\n<p><strong>Rotate employees and volunteers.</strong> Employees who work in finance-related positions should be rotated on a regular basis and required to take time off. Have someone else perform their duties during this time (at least one complete week on an annual basis) as this is the method in which fraud is generally caught. </p>\n<p><strong>Maintain controls over credit cards</strong> to prevent unauthorized spending. Inappropriate credit card spending is a common type of church fraud. Be sure that someone other than a card holder is responsible for reconciling credit card statements each month and that terminated employees and volunteers no longer have access to church credit cards.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevent mishandling of donations</strong> by having two volunteers document each donation’s intended purpose. Leaving the job of documentation to one person increases the risk of funds being directed to the wrong account.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow your instincts.</strong> If you have a suspicion that someone is stealing from your organization, investigate. You can even contact a trained fraud examiner for help.</p>\n<p>If you <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8hebSUVmspQ\">suspect fraud</a>, do not share that information with anyone involved in the process. Instead talk to a local accounting firm that can help you determine your next steps.</p>\n<p>If fraud has occurred, the best response is to involve the authorities. Many churches don’t want to prosecute and will simply fire the employee responsible, allowing that person to move on to other organizations and commit fraud again. Reporting the crime gives the church the chance to recover some of what was taken, since insurance companies often require prosecution for the church to collect coverage on stolen goods. In addition, the church can warn other employers of the person who committed fraud, since prosecution would make the fraud a matter of public record. If that person is not prosecuted, the church will have to be more careful about what they say to the perpetrator’s future employer, as laws on what information may be disclosed in a reference vary from state to state.</p>\n<p>Developing and maintaining strong internal controls and policies can help protect your organization from fraud. Regular audits and reviews can reveal possible weaknesses in your financial policies and procedures, allowing you to revise and create better controls. Through careful planning and follow-through, you can help protect your church from fraud, allowing your organization to focus on ministry.</p>\n<p>To learn more recommended financial practices for protecting your church, click <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/church-finance-ebook/\">here</a> to download our Interactive Guide to Church Finance.</p>\n<p>For more information on risk management and protecting your church from fraud, click <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/insurance/risk-management/resources/\">here</a> to check out our risk management resources or contact AGFinancial Insurance Solutions at 877.616.5206 or info@agfinancialinsurance.com.</p>\n<p><em>This information is not legal, financial, or tax advice.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Doug Clay, General Superintendent of the Assemblies of God, recently sat down with Dr. Richard Hammar, legal counsel for the Assemblies of God, and Jerry Sparks, President of AGFinancial Insurance, to discuss best practices church leaders can put in place to minimize the risk of an active shooter incident on their church campus. Watch the video of their discussion<a href=\"https://youtu.be/wp2eyX41Vcc\"> here</a>.</p>\n<p>The recent shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, which left 26 dead, has shocked our nation and left many pastors and church leaders wondering how they can prevent such a tragedy from happening in their own churches.</p>\n<p>“All people are made in the image of God and deserving of our highest investment to protect their lives and safety,” Dr. Hammar said.</p>\n<p>The church has both a moral and ethical duty to create an active shooter policy even in the absence of a legal obligation. While no church can completely eliminate the risk of an armed intruder, these preventive measures may decrease the risk of such an event and possibly even save lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Law Enforcement</strong><br />\nEnlisting the help of uniformed officers from local police or sheriff’s departments is one of the best ways to mitigate risk. Having a police car parked visibly outside your church building might be a deterrent to potential criminals. Also consider using law enforcement rather than private security during worship due to their specific training requirements. While the cost of security may seem prohibitive, keep in mind the safety of your members.</p>\n<p><strong>Conceal and Carry</strong><br />\nYou may have members in your congregation with <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6ZYcsAV_Rpg\">concealed carry permits</a>, who you can enlist as part of your security team. They need to be vetted as well as trained, matching the training that is done by your local law enforcement. If you are going to have volunteers with concealed weapons, you should also have a <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid92067concealed-carry-church-safety/\">concealed carry policy </a>to help protect your church from liability.</p>\n<p>Click <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid104648church-shootings-who-s-liable/\">here</a> to learn more about church liability in the event of a shooting.</p>\n<p>Take the needed time to create these policies and procedures and put them in place, including ongoing training for those involved. Seek legal and risk management advice from experts, contact local law enforcement and ask for their assistance, and document the steps taken to create the security policy for your church. For more information on how to safely enlist members with conceal and carry permits for your security team, check out this <a href=\"https://media.agfinancial.org/Conceal-Carry.pdf?mtime=20200602234900&focal=none\">white paper</a>.</p>\n<p>While unfortunately there is no way to completely eliminate the risk of a shooting incident in your church, you can put protections in place. Not only do these policies help protect your church and congregation from legal ramifications, but they also demonstrate that your church leadership is doing its best to keep people safe.</p>\n<p>For more detail on the legal ramifications of an active shooter situation and the best practices for prevention, click <a href=\"https://youtu.be/D6kl7mWsBA4\">here</a> to watch Dr. Richard Hammar explain how your church can be prepared for a shooting incident.</p>\n<p>For more information on other ways to keep your church safe, find our risk management resources <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/insurance/risk-management/resources/\">here</a> and download our free <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/insurance/church-risk-management-guide-ebook/\">Church Risk Management Guide</a>.</p>\n<p><em>This information is not legal advice.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>As the song says, Christmas is “the most wonderful time of the year.” But as wonderful as it is, the holiday season can often leave your post-Christmas finances in disarray. Fortunately, with a little planning and preparation, you can take the stress out of shopping and enjoy celebrating Christmas with your loved ones.</p>\n<h4><strong>Determine how much you can spend.</strong></h4>\n<p>Most importantly, set a budget for Christmas spending—not just for gifts, but for food, travel, charitable offerings, and holiday events.</p>\n<h4><strong>Don’t feel obligated to buy for everyone.</strong></h4>\n<p>Families and friendship circles grow. Discuss drawing names or doing a gift exchange with friends and family, instead of buying individual gifts for every person. Chances are you’re not the only one trying to stick to a budget.</p>\n<h4><strong>Make a list—and check it twice.</strong></h4>\n<p>Planning your shopping out in advance can make you less likely to fall victim to impulse purchases. Make a list of gift recipients, set a spending limit for each, and determine what you’d like to buy, and—most importantly—stick to that list.</p>\n<h4><strong>Use cash, not credit.</strong></h4>\n<p>Track your cash by having envelopes for each recipient to help you stay on budget, instead of using credit cards where spending can sometimes get out of hand, leaving you with significant debt to pay off after the holiday. If you do use credit cards, be sure to pay them off as soon as possible.</p>\n<h4><strong>Keep an eye out for the best deals.</strong></h4>\n<p>Don’t buy in a rush. Comparing prices can save you more than money—knowing you’re getting the best possible deal and keeping to your Christmas budget can reduce some of the stress of holiday shopping.</p>\n<h4><strong>Use online shopping to your advantage.</strong></h4>\n<p>When shopping online, be sure to include shipping costs when comparing prices. Many stores also have free shipping offers and discount codes that you can use at checkout.</p>\n<h4><strong>Think of creative (and inexpensive) gift ideas.</strong></h4>\n<p>Consider inexpensive gifts you can make at home. Bake something tasty to give to friends and family or create a personalized gift using craft supplies you already have. Save on gift wrap by using brown paper and string. Then you can use any remaining paper for wrapping other gifts throughout the year.</p>\n<h4><strong>Plan ahead for next year.</strong></h4>\n<p>Start saving for Christmas in January. Make gift spending a line item in your monthly budget for next year. Just $20 saved each week adds up to over $1,000 in a year. Saving for the holidays over the course of the year can reduce the stress of Christmastime shopping, gives you the flexibility to be generous to those less fortunate, and allows you to slow down and enjoy all that makes the season special.</p>\n<p>Christmas is coming soon, and it can easily be the most expensive time of the year. Start preparing today to rid yourself of the financial frustrations that often come with the season.

Check out these five ways to declutter your finances.</p>\n<p><strong>Go digital.</strong><br />\nDo you have stacks of mail, bills, and statements that pile up? An easy way to avoid the clutter is to move to paperless billing and e-statements. Most companies and banks also allow you to automate monthly payments, like utility bills, insurance, and loan payments. By making these payments automatic, you can save significant energy and time. Just be aware of when automatic payments occur and make sure that there is enough money in your account to cover the withdrawals. AGFinancial offers electronic statements, among other paperless options, to help declutter your mailbox. Sign up <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/onlineaccess\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Create a debt payment plan.</strong><br />\nWhen you pay off debt, you free up additional income which can be used for savings, retirement, or investments. There are several ways to pay off debt, but the most common are the debt avalanche method and the debt snowball method. With the debt avalanche plan, you use the money you have left over each month after paying bills and other expenses to pay down the debt with the highest interest rate first. The debt snowball method involves using your leftover income to pay down the debt with the lowest amount first, regardless of interest rate. No matter which method you use, paying off debts will reduce your number of monthly transactions, simplifying your finances.</p>\n<p><strong>Combine your insurance policies.</strong><br />\nJust as having multiple accounts at multiple banks overcomplicates your finances, having insurance policies with different companies may create unnecessary financial stress. If you bundle all your insurance policies together with the same company, you can potentially save money and simplify your financial life. AGFinancial Insurance Solutions now offers personal lines insurance, so you can cover your life, home, and vehicles all in one place.

You can simplify your retirement with a rollover, putting all your funds into one account, whether that’s an <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/403b/\">403(b)</a> or an <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/ira/\">IRA</a>.

Go through your clothing, books, and household goods and sell the unwanted items online through websites like Craigslist or eBay, or simply have a yard sale. The money you make can be used to start or contribute to your emergency fund. As for the items you don’t sell, donate them to a local thrift store and collect a receipt so you can claim the donation as a deduction on your tax return.</p>\n<p>Financial management doesn’t have to be complicated. With a little effort, you can cut the clutter out of your finances and enjoy more free time and a lot less stress.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>With schools back in session and the weather starting to cool, it’s clear that fall is here. Many churches plan fall festivals during this season as a fun, family-friendly way to reach the community and spread the Gospel. But a large event with a variety of activities can present numerous risks to your church. Fortunately, with a little forethought and planning, you can protect your ministry and create a fun, safe environment for the families in your community.</p>\n<p>Below are six tips for hosting a safe fall festival at your church.</p>\n<p><strong>1) Make sure your ministry is covered.</strong><br />\nPrior to hosting a fall festival or any special event, your church should review its insurance policy and make sure that the policy covers activities outside of the regular ministry schedule. Some policies have special events exclusions, which could leave your church unprotected in the event of an injury or accident at your fall event.</p>\n<p>If you use any third-party vendors, whether for food, games, or inflatables, require them to sign a contract with the church and provide a certificate of insurance. Keep an eye out for indemnification language in the contract that states your church will hold the company harmless if anything happens—if not deleted, your ministry could end up being liable in the event of an accident caused by that vendor’s service.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Provide proper supervision.</strong><br />\nSupervision is essential to having a safe and enjoyable festival. At least two adults should be on hand in each area to supervise every activity, from games to inflatables to bonfires. If you have teen volunteers working as well, make sure each one is paired with an adult. As with any other church activity, require all <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/staff-volunteer-resource-kit/\">volunteers</a> to pass a background check and a reference check.</p>\n<p>Consider creating a security team, especially if your fall festival is a large event. Just the presence of a security team can dissuade many participants from unsafe behaviors, and if an incident does occur, this team can be responsible for securing the situation and contacting the proper authorities, if necessary. It’s also a good idea to consider having a medical professional available to tend to any minor injuries or emergencies.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Keep parking and traffic organized.</strong><br />\nBe sure to have some form of traffic control in place. Develop a parking plan and determine what options are available for overflow parking, should you need it. Many festivals continue after dark, so ensure that the parking lot has proper lighting to protect children and adults walking to and from cars. Depending on the size of your event, you may need to ask for help from local law enforcement to direct traffic.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Ensure that rules are known and followed.</strong><br />\nEstablish safety rules for each game or activity and post these rules in a visible place. Certain events like <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5N_3mL-Y06w?list=PLS35Et-nHKCyBb23R2pHbuDu-YmGETdQT\">hayrides</a> and bonfires offer a higher potential for injury, so require volunteers in charge of those events to make the safety rules clear to participants. Keep in mind that safety rules are of no use if they’re not implemented—have volunteers monitor the activity and make sure everyone follows the established rules.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Avoid injuries from inflatables.</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/0Dc5LHx3CPU\">Inflatables</a>, like bounce houses, can be a significant hazard if they are not properly set up and monitored. Be sure to rent inflatables from a reputable, insured company that will perform the installation and tear-down for you. Require adult supervision of inflatables at all times, and be aware of weight and age limits. If your inflatable will be outside, keep a close watch on the weather forecast and wind speed, as high winds can cause inflatables to blow over.</p>\n<p><strong>6) Pay attention to the details.</strong><br />\nCandy is a fun reward for games and activities, but make sure the candy you use is safe. Only hand out prepackaged candy to children and remind parents to throw away any candy that looks like it may have been tampered with.</p>\n<p>Flickering candles can create a festive ambiance, but having open flames is unnecessary and potentially dangerous. Instead, use nonflammable LED candles to create the same glow without the fire hazard.</p>\n<p>While this list doesn’t cover every aspect of planning a fall festival, it offers a good starting point. A strong safety plan creates a safer environment for all in attendance and allows both volunteers and participants to enjoy your church festival.</p>\n<p>For more information about church risk management, check out our <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/insurance/risk-management/resources/\">risk management resources</a>, where you’ll find free videos, articles, and downloads.</p>\n<p><em>This information is not legal advice.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Be prepared.</p>\n<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the April US unemployment rate increased to 14.7%, the highest level since the Great Depression. Market volatility is at levels last seen during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. We are in an economic environment that many of us have never seen.</p>\n<p>It is times like this that we are reminded of the importance of being prepared for the potential loss of income or investments. It’s not a new concept-the protection and management of your finances should always be a priority. But now, seeing so many people out of work and in financial distress, we really understand the wisdom and rationale behind the idea. Read on as we present four areas to help you assess your current financial situation and level of preparedness.</p>\n<p><strong>Your Savings</strong></p>\n<p>Now more than ever, it’s clear that having an emergency fund should be considered a necessity. Whether you need to start saving or need to increase your current savings—make a positive change now. Having an emergency fund (a minimum of 3-6 months’ worth of expenses is recommended) not only helps to reduce stress in a time of crisis, but it can protect you against incurring debt or tapping into your retirement savings. When looking for the money to place into the emergency fund, you may want to reevaluate those areas in your budget that you considered essential prior to the current crisis.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/investments/\">Click here</a> to open a liquid investment for your emergency fund or learn how AGFinancial can help you as you build your emergency fund, while receiving a competitive rate and helping to grow ministry.*</p>\n<p><strong>Your Cash</strong></p>\n<p>Consider if you should keep a limited amount of cash on hand in the event of an emergency. Whether it is needed to make a curbside purchase, help someone in need, or a widespread power outage, it may not always be convenient or possible to access your bank account or use a plastic card. You do not want to keep a lot of cash at home, just enough perhaps for a week of groceries. And for security you might want to consider a small fire-proof safe.</p>\n<p><strong>Your Retirement</strong></p>\n<p>If the recent market volatility has kept you up at night, it may be time to reevaluate your risk tolerance. Be sure to consider how near to retirement age you are, and whether there would be time for your portfolio to recover in the event of another large market correction. Learn more about risk tolerance <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/biggest-mistakes-investors-make-part-3/\">here</a>. If you are comfortable with your risk tolerance and you have an investment plan, you may not need to change your approach, but you still may need to rebalance your portfolio. Large swings in investments, as we have witnessed lately, can cause your portfolio to veer from the target strategy that you had put in place. This means the investments are “out of balance,” and rebalancing might be necessary to maintain your appropriate level of risk and return.</p>\n<p>If you have not yet started saving for your retirement, now is the time to start. AGFinancial provides a <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/403b/\">403(b)</a> plan for AG credentialed ministers and ministry employees. We also provide <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/ira/\">IRAs</a> (individual retirement accounts) for those without access to an employer-sponsored plan or as a supplement.</p>\n<p><strong>Your Time</strong></p>\n<p>Many of us have sheltered at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, connecting on social media, baking, or streaming our favorite shows. The slower pace may have allowed us time to declutter and focus on what’s most important to us. As we begin moving forward and starting to return to work and life as we knew it, we can continue to reduce clutter and simplify in all areas of life.</p>\n<p>Regarding your finances, you may have multiple retirement accounts that you can <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/3-reasons-to-rollover-your-retirement/\">roll over</a> into a single account to better align your investment choices and to reduce paperwork.

    "excerpt": "A detailed review of how these changes will benefit churches and staff. Richard Hammar",
    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>A detailed review of how these changes will benefit churches and staff.<br />\nRichard Hammar</p>\n<p>In the waning hours of 2019, Congress enacted the “Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019” (the SECURE Act). The Act included several previous legislative initiatives that had not been enacted, and generally incentivizes taxpayers to save for retirement.</p>\n<p>Here are six provisions most relevant to churches and church staff:</p>\n<p>• increases to 72 the age after which required minimum distributions from certain retirement accounts must begin;<br />\n• repeals the prohibition on contributions to a traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA) by an individual who has reached age 70½;<br />\n• allows penalty-free distributions from qualified retirement plans and IRAs for births and adoptions;<br />\n• specifies those individuals who may be covered by pension plans maintained by church-controlled organizations;<br />\n• expands “section 529” education savings accounts to cover costs associated with registered apprenticeships, student loan repayments, and certain costs associated with elementary and secondary education and homeschooling.<br />\n• increases the penalty for failure to file to the lesser of $435 or 100 percent of the amount of the tax due.</p>\n<p><strong>Required minimum distributions</strong></p>\n<p>You cannot keep retirement funds in your account indefinitely. Under prior law, you generally had to start taking withdrawals (called required minimum distributions or RMDs) annually from all employer sponsored retirement plans (including 403(b) plans) starting with the year that you reached age 70½ or, if later, the year in which you retired (if allowed by your plan). The beginning date for your first RMD was December 31 of the year you turned age 70½, although you were allowed to delay your first RMD until April 1 of the following year. But doing so meant that you had two RMDs for that year, due on April 1 and December 31.</p>\n<p>The RMD rules apply to all employer-sponsored retirement plans, including 403(b) plans and traditional IRAs and IRA-based plans such as SEPs, SARSEPs, and SIMPLE IRAs. Retirement plan participants and IRA owners are responsible for taking the correct amount of RMDs on time every year from their accounts. They face stiff penalties for failure to do so.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Key point</strong>. If you do not take any distributions, or if the distributions are not large enough, you may have to pay a 50 percent excise tax on the amount not distributed as required.</em></p>\n<p>Generally, an RMD is calculated for each account by dividing the prior December 31 balance of that IRA or retirement plan account by a life expectancy factor that the IRS publishes in tables in Publication 590-B, Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs). Choose the life expectancy table to use based on your situation.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Key point</strong>. When mandatory distributions from qualified retirement plans based on age were added to the tax code in 1962, the life expectancy of Americans was shorter. In addition, increasing numbers of Americans are continuing to work past traditional retirement ages. Based on these circumstances, Congress concluded that it is appropriate to increase the age by which RMDs must be made to more accurately reflect present-day conditions.</em></p>\n<p>The SECURE Act changes the age on which the beginning date for RMDs is based, from the calendar year in which the employee or IRA owner attains 70½ years to the calendar year in which the employee or IRA owner attains 72 years. However, prior law continues to apply to employees and IRA owners who attain age 70½ prior to January 1, 2020.</p>\n<p>This provision is effective for distributions required to be made after December 31, 2019, for employees and IRA owners who attain age 70½ after December 31, 2019. In all other respects, prior law treatment of RMDs is not affected.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Caution.</strong> The terms of your employer-sponsored retirement plan may allow employees to wait until the year they actually retire to take their first RMD. Alternatively, a plan may require employees to begin receiving distributions by April 1 of the year after they reach age 72 even if they have not retired. In some cases, employers will need to amend their plan to enable employees to benefit from the new rule.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Key point</strong>. What has not changed is the requirement to actuarially adjust accrued benefit for an employee who retires in a calendar year after the year the employee attains age 70½, to take into account the period after age 70½ in which the employee was not receiving any benefits under the plan.</em></p>\n<p>After the first RMD, you must take subsequent RMDs by December 31 of each year beginning with the calendar year containing your required beginning date. The first year following the year you reach age 72 you will generally have two required distribution dates: an April 1 withdrawal (for the year you turn 72), and an additional withdrawal by December 31 (for the year following the year you turn 72). To avoid having both of these amounts included in your income for the same year, you can make your first withdrawal by December 31 of the year you turn 72 instead of waiting until April 1 of the following year.</p>\n<p>To avoid having both of these amounts included in your income for the same year, you can make your first withdrawal by December 31 of the year you turn 72 instead of waiting until April 1 of the following year.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>. Pastor John reaches age 72 on August 20, 2022. He must receive his first RMD by April 1, 2023, based on his 2022 year-end balance. He must receive his second required minimum distribution by December 31, 2023, based on his 2022 year-end balance. If Pastor John receives his initial RMD for 2022 on April 1, 2023, then both his 2022 and 2023 distributions will be included in income on his 2023 income tax return. To avoid this problem, Pastor John should receive his first RMD by December 22, 2022. </em></p>\n<p>Note the following additional developments regarding RMDs:</p>\n<p>• One effect of increasing the age for an initial RMD is that the RMD calculation will be based on fewer years and more retirement assets meaning that RMDs will be slightly larger.</p>\n<p>• Increasing the initial RMD from April 1 of the year following the year in which you turn 70½ to the year following the year in which you turn 72 comports more with how we naturally reckon time.</p>\n<p>• Many retired workers depend on income from their employer-sponsored retirement plan (including 403(b) plans) for living expenses, and many will be exceeding their applicable RMD without legal compulsion.</p>\n<p>• The cable news network CNBC has estimated that under the new rules “a theoretical $500,000 portfolio, earning 5 percent annually, would have $33,500 more at age 89 if the RMDs started at age 72.”</p>\n<p>• An earlier version of the SECURE Act would have raised the initial RMD age to 75. This provision had substantial bipartisan support, but in the end was dropped.</p>\n<p>• Although the IRA custodian or retirement plan administrator may calculate the RMD, the IRA or retirement plan account owner is ultimately responsible for calculating the amount of the RMD.</p>\n<p>• The 50 percent penalty on undistributed amounts may be waived if the account owner establishes that the shortfall in distributions was due to reasonable error and that reasonable steps are being taken to remedy the shortfall. In order to qualify for this relief, you must file Form 5329 and attach a letter of explanation.</p>\n<p>• In the past, a modified required minimum distribution applied to IRA beneficiaries following the death of the IRA account holder. A 5-year rule required most IRA beneficiaries to withdraw 100 percent of the IRA by December 31 of the year containing the fifth anniversary of the owner’s death. For example, if the owner died in 2018, the beneficiary would have had to fully distribute the plan by December 31, 2023. The beneficiary was allowed, but not required, to take distributions prior to that date. The 5-year rule never applied if the owner died on or after his or her required beginning date. The SECURE Act extended this to a 10-year rule.</p>\n<p><strong>IRA contributions for persons who have reached age 70½</strong></p>\n<p>Under prior law, an individual who had attained age 70½ by the close of a year was not permitted to make contributions to a traditional IRA. This restriction did not apply to contributions to a Roth IRA. In addition, employees over age 70½ were not precluded from contributing to employer-sponsored plans.</p>\n<p>The SECURE Act repeals the prohibition on contributions to a traditional IRA by an individual who has attained age 70½. This change was based on the reality that as Americans live longer, increasing numbers are continuing to work past traditional retirement ages. This provides such working individuals with current income, as well as the potential for additional retirement savings. An individual working past age 70½ may contribute to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, if available, or to a Roth IRA or to a traditional IRA.</p>\n<p>This provision applies to contributions made for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2019.</p>\n<p>P<strong>enalty-free distributions from qualified retirement plans and IRAs for births and adoptions</strong></p>\n<p>Under prior law, a distribution from a qualified retirement plan, a tax-sheltered annuity plan (a ‘section 403(b) plan), or an IRA generally is included in taxable income for the year distributed. These plans are referred to collectively as ‘‘eligible retirement plans.’’ In addition, unless an exception applies, a distribution from a qualified retirement plan, a section 403(b) plan, or an IRA received before age 59½ is subject to a 10-percent additional tax (referred to as the ‘‘early withdrawal tax’’) on the amount includible in income.</p>\n<p>The SECURE Act creates an exception to the 10-percent early withdrawal penalty in the case of qualified birth or adoption distributions from an applicable eligible retirement plan. This provision was based on the following excerpt from the House Ways and Means Committee report:</p>\n<p>Births and adoptions are important life events that can come with significant financial costs for a family. The Committee believes that, in these situations, individuals should have access to portions of their retirement savings to help pay for these costs. The ability to access retirement savings on a penalty-free basis at the time of the birth of a child or adoption will provide such flexibility. As a result, the Committee believes this will encourage younger workers to save earlier for their retirement, whether through participation in an employer-sponsored plan or an IRA.</p>\n<p>In addition to an exception to the 10-percent early withdrawal penalty, qualified birth or adoption distributions may be recontributed to an individual’s applicable eligible retirement plans, subject to certain requirements. The report of the House Ways and Means Committee providers this clarification:</p>\n<p><em>A qualified birth or adoption distribution</em> is a permissible distribution from an applicable eligible retirement plan which, for this purpose, encompasses eligible retirement plans other than defined benefit plans, including qualified retirement plans, section 403(b) plans, and IRAs.</p>\n<p><em>A qualified birth or adoption distribution</em> is a distribution from an applicable eligible retirement plan (including qualified retirement plans, section 403(b) plans, and IRAs) to an individual if made during the one-year period beginning on the date on which [including qualified retirement plans, section 403(b) plans, and IRAs] a child of the individual is born or on which the legal adoption by the individual of an eligible adoptee is finalized. An eligible adoptee means any individual (other than a child of the taxpayer’s spouse) who has not attained age 18 or is physically or mentally incapable of self-support. The provision requires the name, age, and taxpayer identification number of the child or eligible adoptee to which any qualified birth or adoption distribution relates to be provided on the tax return of the individual taxpayer for the taxable year.</p>\n<p>The maximum aggregate amount which may be treated as qualified birth or adoption distributions by any individual with respect to a birth or adoption is $5,000. The maximum aggregate amount applies on an individual basis. Therefore, each spouse separately may receive a maximum aggregate amount of $5,000 of qualified birth or adoption distributions (with respect to a birth or adoption) from applicable eligible retirement plans in which each spouse participates or holds accounts.</p>\n<p>An employer plan is not treated as violating any tax code requirement merely because it treats a distribution (that would otherwise be a qualified birth or adoption distribution) to an individual as a qualified birth or adoption distribution, provided that the aggregate amount of such distributions to that individual from plans maintained by the employer and members of the employer’s controlled group does not exceed $5,000. Thus, under such circumstances an employer plan is not treated as violating any tax code requirement merely because an individual might receive total distributions in excess of $5,000 as a result of distributions from plans of other employers or IRAs.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Key point</strong>. Generally, any portion of a qualified birth or adoption distribution may, at any time after the date on which the distribution was received, be recontributed to an applicable eligible retirement plan to which a rollover can be made. Such a recontribution is treated as a rollover and thus is not includible in income.</em></p>\n<p>If an employer adds the ability for plan participants to receive qualified birth or adoption distributions from a plan, the plan must permit an employee who has received qualified birth or adoption distributions from that plan to recontribute only up to the amount that was distributed from that plan to that employee, provided the employee otherwise is eligible to make contributions (other than recontributions of qualified birth or adoption distributions) to that plan.</p>\n<p>Any portion of a qualified birth or adoption distribution from an individual’s applicable eligible retirement plans (whether employer plans or IRAs) may be recontributed to an IRA held by such an individual which is an applicable eligible retirement plan to which a rollover can be made.</p>\n<p>This provision applies to distributions made after December 31, 2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifies those individuals who may be covered by pension plans maintained by church-controlled organizations</strong></p>\n<p>Assets of a tax-sheltered annuity plan (a section 403(b) plan), generally must be invested in annuity contracts or mutual funds. However, the restrictions on investments do not apply to a retirement income account, which is a defined contribution program established or maintained by a church, or a convention or association of churches, to provide benefits under the plan to employees of a religious, charitable, or similar tax-exempt organization.</p>\n<p>Certain rules prohibiting discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees, which apply to section 403(b) plans generally, do not apply to a plan maintained by a church or qualified church-controlled organization. For this purpose, church means a church, a convention or association of churches, or an elementary or secondary school that is controlled, operated, or principally supported by a church or by a convention or association of churches, and includes a qualified church-controlled organization.</p>\n<p>A qualified church-controlled organization is any church-controlled tax-exempt organization other than an organization that:</p>\n<p>• offers goods, services, or facilities for sale, other than on an incidental basis, to the general public, other than goods, services, or facilities that are sold at a nominal charge substantially less than the cost of providing the goods, services, or facilities; and</p>\n<p>• normally receives more than 25 percent of its support from either governmental sources, or receipts from admissions, sales of merchandise, performance of services, or furnishing of facilities, in activities that are not unrelated trades or businesses, or from both. Church-controlled organizations that are not qualified church-controlled organizations are generally referred to as ‘‘nonqualified church-controlled organizations.’’</p>\n<p>In recent years, a question has arisen as to whether employees of nonqualified church-controlled organizations may be covered under a section 403(b) plan that consists of a retirement income account. The SECURE Act clarifies that a retirement income account may cover:</p>\n<p>1. a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church in the exercise of his ministry, regardless of the source of compensation;<br />\n2. an employee of an organization, whether a civil law corporation or otherwise, that is exempt from tax under section 501 and is controlled by or associated with a church or a convention or association of churches; and<br />\n3. an employee who is included in a church plan under certain circumstances after separation from the service of a church, a convention or association of churches, or an organization described above.</p>\n<p>This provision applies to years beginning before, on, or after the date of enactment.</p>\n<p><strong>Expansion of “Section 529” education savings accounts to cover costs associated with student loan repayments and certain costs associated with elementary and secondary education</strong></p>\n<p>A section 529 plan (also known as a \"qualified tuition plan\") is a plan operated by a state or educational institution with tax advantages and potentially other incentives to make it easier to save for college and other post-secondary training for a designated beneficiary, such as a child or grandchild.</p>\n<p>The main tax advantage of a 529 plan is that earnings are not subject to federal tax and generally are not subject to state tax when used for the qualified education expenses of the designated beneficiary, such as tuition, fees, books, as well as room and board. Contributions to a 529 plan, however, are not deductible.</p>\n<p>Contributions to a 529 plan cannot exceed the amount necessary to provide for the qualified education expenses of the beneficiary. If you contribute to a 529 plan, however, be aware that there may be gift tax consequences if your contributions, plus any other gifts, to a particular beneficiary exceed $15,000 during the year.</p>\n<p>The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 modified section 529 plans to allow such plans to distribute not more than $10,000 in expenses for tuition incurred during the taxable year in connection with the enrollment or attendance of the designated beneficiary at a public, private, or religious elementary or secondary school. This limitation applies on a per-student basis, rather than a per-account basis. Thus, although an individual may be the designated beneficiary of multiple accounts, that individual may receive a maximum of $10,000 in distributions free of tax, regardless of whether the funds are distributed from multiple accounts. Any excess distributions received by the individual would be treated as a distribution subject to tax under the general rules of section 529.</p>\n<p>The final text of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act deleted a provision modifying the definition of higher education expenses to include certain expenses incurred in connection with a homeschool.</p>\n<p>The SECURE Act makes the following three changes to 529 plans.</p>\n<p>First, the Act allows tax-free treatment to apply to distributions made for certain expenses in connection with a homeschool. Under the provision, distributions for certain homeschool expenses are treated in the same manner as distributions for qualified higher education expenses, and like distributions for elementary and secondary school tuition are also subject to an annual limit of $10,000 in aggregate 529 distributions, per beneficiary.</p>\n<p>For these purposes, qualifying homeschool expenses are those expenses, with respect to a beneficiary, which are incurred in connection with a homeschool and are for: curriculum and curricular materials; books or other instructional materials; online educational materials; tuition for tutoring or educational classes outside of the home if the tutor or instructor is unrelated to the student; dual enrollment in an institution of higher education; and educational therapies for students with disabilities.</p>\n<p>Second, the Act allows tax-free treatment to apply to distributions of certain amounts used to make payments on principal or interest of a qualified education loan. No individual may receive more than $10,000 of such distributions, in aggregate, over the course of the individual’s lifetime. To the extent that an individual receives in excess of $10,000 of such distributions, they are subject to the usual tax treatment of 529 distributions (i.e., the earnings are included in income and subject to a 10-percent penalty). The provision contains a special rule allowing such amounts to be distributed to a sibling of a designated beneficiary (i.e., a brother, sister, stepbrother, or stepsister). This rule allows a 529 account holder to make a student loan distribution to a sibling of the designated beneficiary without changing the designated beneficiary of the account. For purposes of the $10,000 lifetime limit on student loan distributions, a distribution to a sibling of a designated beneficiary is applied toward the sibling’s lifetime limit, and not the designated beneficiary’s lifetime limit. The deduction available for interest paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year on any qualified education loan is disallowed to the extent such interest was paid from a tax-free distribution from a 529 plan.</p>\n<p>Third, the Act allows tax-free treatment to apply to distributions made for certain additional qualifying expenses on behalf of designated beneficiaries attending elementary or secondary<br />\nschool. Under the provision, in addition to tuition, tax-free treatment would apply to a distribution made for expenses for fees, academic tutoring, special needs services, books, supplies, and other equipment, incurred in connection with enrollment or attendance at such elementary or secondary school.</p>\n<p>The provision applies to distributions made after December 31, 2018.</p>\n<p><strong>Increases failure-to-file penalty</strong></p>\n<p>Regarding the failure-to-file penalty, the Taxpayer First Act of 2019 stated the following:</p>\n<p>The Federal tax system is one of ‘‘self-assessment,’’ i.e., taxpayers are required to declare their income, expenses, and ultimate tax due, while the IRS has the ability to propose subsequent changes. This voluntary system requires that taxpayers comply with deadlines and adhere to the filing requirements. While taxpayers may obtain extensions of time in which to file their returns, the Federal tax system consists of specific due dates of returns. In order to foster compliance in meeting these deadlines, Congress has enacted a penalty for the failure to timely file tax returns.</p>\n<p>A taxpayer who fails to file a tax return on or before its due date is subject to a penalty equal to five percent of the net amount of tax due for each month that the return is not filed, up to a maximum of 25 percent of the net amount. If the failure to file a return is fraudulent, the taxpayer is subject to a penalty equal to 15 percent of the net amount of tax due for each month the return is not filed, up to a maximum of 75 percent of the net amount. The net amount of tax due is the amount of tax required to be shown on the return reduced by the amount of any part of the tax that is paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the tax and by the amount of any credits against tax that may be claimed on the return. The penalty will not apply if it is shown that the failure to file was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.</p>\n<p>If a return is filed more than 60 days after its due date, and unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause, then the failure to file penalty may not be less than the lesser of $205 or 100 percent of the amount required to be shown as tax on the return. If a penalty for failure to file and a penalty for failure to pay tax shown on a return both apply for the same month, the amount of the penalty for failure to file for such month is reduced by the amount of the penalty for failure to pay tax shown on a return. If a return is filed more than 60 days after its due date, then the penalty for failure to pay tax shown on a return may not reduce the penalty for failure to file below the lesser of $205 or 100 percent of the amount required to be shown on the return.</p>\n<p>The failure to file penalty applies to all . . . income tax returns of an individual, fiduciary of an estate or trust, or corporation, self-employment tax returns, and estate and gift tax returns.</p>\n<p>The SECURE Act increases the failure-to-file penalty to the lesser of $435 or 100 percent of the amount of tax due for returns due after December 31, 2019.</p>\n<p>The House Ways and Means Committee noted that the penalties for failing to file tax returns have not been increased in several years, and it believes that increasing the penalties will encourage the filing of timely and accurate returns which, in turn, will improve overall tax administration.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Has the recent volatility in the market kept you up at night? Do you find yourself preoccupied with the market swings? If so, read on as we share insights and answers to common questions regarding risk tolerance and the role it should play when investing during times of market fluctuations.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. The volatile markets are unnerving. What are the most important things to consider when investing during market volatility?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The two areas that come to mind are risk tolerance and long-term goals. When it comes to investing, regardless of market conditions, you should always keep focused on your goals. It’s normal for people to get concerned in times of extreme circumstances. But, this concern should not translate to anxiety with investing – even in a season of market volatility. It’s good to remember your long-term investment goals and stick to it. Keep in mind that the S&P 500 has seen many market corrections over the last several decades, yet 30 of the last 40 years have brought a positive return.</p>\n<p>Risk is another area investors need to know more about—both understanding what risk is, as well as understanding their personal tolerance level for it. Risk is defined as exposure to the chance of loss. Risk is not about how high your possible returns might be, but rather about understanding your potential for losses as well as gains. It is important to understand the relationship between risk and reward; the bigger the possible reward, the greater the risk.</p>\n<p>Even more so in a volatile market, it’s easy for investors to focus more on returns and lose sight of the involved risk. Remember that if your investment has the potential to make 20% in the market, it also may have the potential to lose 20% or more. The Great Recession of 2008-2009 had two significant positives: 1) it reminded us that the market is unpredictable, and 2) it provided buying opportunities. The irony is that because investors had not properly understood their own risk, the Great Recession left them scared and paralyzed.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I know how much risk is safe to take?</strong></p>\n<p>A: You’ve heard the quote, “you’re your own worst enemy.” This can be especially true when it comes to investment portfolios and not making decisions based on your risk tolerance. There are a variety of quizzes available online to help investors identify their risk level.</p>\n<p>Determining your risk tolerance is not a one-time-only event. Your risk tolerance level in your 20s may not be the same when you are in your 40s. Your tolerance for risk can shift due to age, changes in family status, income, etc., and therefore should be assessed periodically.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, you have to know your financial objectives and understand how much risk you’re willing to take. Focus on developing a portfolio that matches your risk tolerance level.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: So I need to look at more than just my age when determining my risk tolerance?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The industry often suggests how much risk you could take based on time. For example, the further away from retirement you are, the more risk they would suggest you take. And conversely, the closer to retirement you are, the less risk they may suggest you take. While this is an accepted generality, in our opinion investment decisions should be based more on personality. For instance, the industry may advise an investor in their 30s to take more risk. But if that 30-year-old has a personality that is more risk-averse, they would most likely panic and overreact to market downturns, which could cause more harm to their portfolio than if they had invested according to their personality (less risk).</p>\n<p>If you are nearing retirement age, we urge you to be very careful with risk. Work with a trusted advisor when thinking about reallocating your investments. A market correction could devastate your portfolio at a time when you can least afford a loss. You simply may not have adequate time to allow your investments to recover.</p>\n<p>For those looking for less risk, a popular investment option within the AG 403(b) is the fixed rate <a href=\"http://files.agfinancial.org/Retirement/Fund-Descriptors/MBA-Income-Fund.pdf\">MBA Income Fund</a>, having provided a stable rate of return since inception more than 60 years ago. As of January 1, 2020, the annualized return since inception is 6.51%.*</p>\n<p>Final Thought:</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it’s the investor’s choices that could do the most damage to a portfolio. By properly evaluating your risk tolerance, you can reduce the likelihood of making poor investment decisions.</p>\n<p>If you’re an AG 403(b) participant, familiarize yourself with the <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/403b/fund-descriptors/\">investment options</a> available within the plan. From the MBA Income Fund to the multiple stock strategies, there are investment options within the plan for all risk tolerance levels.</p>\n<p><em>*Historical performance does not guarantee future results.</em></p>\n<p><em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p><em>This information is not legal, financial, or tax advice.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>If you haven’t already heard, 50 is the new 30.</p>\n<p>Except when it comes to saving for retirement. And sadly, time stops for no one. If your savings are not already on track to provide a secure retirement, it’s past time to get serious about your future. And if you haven’t yet begun to save, take the first step and open your <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/403b/\">403(b)</a> or <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/investments/ira/\">IRA</a> today. The good news is that it’s not too late to make an impact on your retirement.</p>\n<p>Read on for pointers to help you start moving your balance upwards:</p>\n<h4><strong>Increase your 403(b) savings. Today. </strong></h4>\n<p>Up until now, you should have been increasing your retirement contributions annually. But today is a new day. Make an <a href=\"http://files.agfinancial.org/retirement/Payroll-Deduction-Form.pdf\">increase</a> today and commit to increasing it with every future pay raise.</p>\n<h4><strong>Take advantage of catch-up contributions</strong></h4>\n<p>For those already 50 or older, you can take advantage of Uncle Sam’s catch-up provision—a little extra savings incentive in the form of an elective deferral. What this means is that you can save an additional $6,000 a year over the normal contribution limit in employer-sponsored retirement plans (for example your 403(b)). On January 1, 2020, that amount raises to $6,500.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/investments/ira/\">traditional or Roth IRA</a> has a catch-up amount of $1,000 for 2019, and remains unchanged for 2020.</p>\n<p>Click <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/#Annual-Contribution-Limits\">here</a> to see the full table of contribution limits for 2019 and the newly released limits for 2020.</p>\n<h4><strong>Recognize the value of time</strong></h4>\n<p>Time is needed to allow your funds to grow and compound. You may still have 10-20 years left until you retire, so get started now to put compound interest to work for you. And remember, with compound interest you aren’t just receiving interest on the money contributed, you’re earning interest on the interest you’ve already received. Time allows your savings to increase exponentially.</p>\n<h4><strong>Work with your spouse </strong></h4>\n<p>Perhaps you are fortunate enough to be able to max out your contributions. If so, and if your spouse doesn’t have employment income, consider funding a spousal IRA. If your spouse has access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, be sure he or she (and you) are maximizing any employer match available. Don’t throw away money offered to you.</p>\n<h4><strong>Be willing to prioritize</strong></h4>\n<p>You may need to adjust your spending priorities. For instance, holding off on buying a new car for another year or two could allow for increased retirement contributions. You can also consider cost-efficient alternatives or different approaches for other high-dollar items, such as your housing and kids’ college tuition.</p>\n<p><strong>Look at how you spend your money through the lens of how it may affect your retirement. </strong></p>\n<p>The bottom line is you are responsible for your retirement. You need to realistically look at where you stand today and if needed, make changes. It may be that you are willing to delay your retirement a few years rather than tighten your belt any more. Or you may decide that you are willing to cut back on your spending and invest more for your future. It’s your retirement and you ultimately decide what that retirement will look like.</p>\n<h4>Catch-up checklist:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Open an <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/types-of-accounts/#accounts\">account</a>, if you do not have one.</li>\n<li>Increase your <a href=\"http://files.agfinancial.org/retirement/Payroll-Deduction-Form.pdf\">contributions.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/52-ways-to-save-ebook/\">Reduce spending</a> to further increase your contribution.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

The way you minister is unique. Let the design of your facilities reflect your story.</p>\n<p>The DNA of your church is your story, and it is derived from its people, history, culture, location, and vision, among other factors.

Using passphrases – phrases that are over 25 characters long, including spaces (if your system allows), creates a complex barrier that a single password doesn't. Routinely changing that passphrase is ideal, as well as creating unique passphrases for each login.</p>\n<p>3) Create \"air-gaps\" between you and your stored data.</p>\n<p>It's a best practice to back up your data, but when it comes to storing that backup, creating gaps between you and that data can help improve security. An \"air-gap\" is produced by storing backups on a device that's not connected to the network or by uploading it to a cloud storage system.</p>\n<p>4) Speak with the experts.</p>\n<p>Seeking out cybersecurity professionals who can help strengthen the security of your data is a smart step to safeguarding your data. It's also important to find a knowledgeable insurance agent that can discuss the ins and outs of cyber liability coverage and how it can benefit your church or organization. Listen to Jerry Sparks speak specifically on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8Jg1tE3BqS8?t=1042\">cyber liability and how it can help churches here</a>.</p>\n<p>To gain detailed insight on cybersecurity, watch AGFinancial Insurance Solutions' <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Jg1tE3BqS8&amp;feature=youtu.be\">full video on Cybersecurity for Churches.</a></p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

Her parents weren’t Christians, but she loved going to church — Sunday morning, Sunday night, youth group, special services — if the church was doing something, she wanted to be there. She grew up seeing church as a bright and loving environment. But in a moment of trust, her world became indescribably dark.</p>\n<p>Chris says that <a href=\"https://ngm.ag.org/\">Mpact Girls</a> (then known as Missionettes) at the AG church in Indiana she attended really activated her involvement in church. In time, she felt called into the ministry.</p>\n<p>“I decided to attend North Central Bible College — now <a href=\"https://www.northcentral.edu/\">North Central University</a> — in Minneapolis,” Chris says. “I started attending a nearby church and I volunteered immediately, because finding a place to minister was something you just did.”</p>\n<p>Chris, then 18, began working as a church volunteer with elementary-age girls, who met on Sunday nights. One evening she had just finished setting up her girls’ room when John, a volunteer in another ministry, asked her for some help. He told her he was throwing a surprise birthday party for one of the leaders and needed some help carrying in the supplies from his car.</p>\n<p><strong>THE NIGHTMARE</strong></p>\n<p>When Chris went to John’s car to help, she was abducted, taken to a remote park, and sustained significant injuries to her ankles. “I remember waking up at one point, lying on the ground,” she says. “I didn’t know what was going on, but I clearly remember the peace of God was present. The peace of God was so strong and real, and I felt the Lord telling me people were praying.”</p>\n<p>Carolyn Tennant, the vice president of student life at North Central at the time, recalls that the girls on Chris’ dorm floor stayed up all night praying for Chris when she didn’t return from church that night — fearing something was wrong.</p>\n<p>“I look back on that night and the commitment of those girls who prayed and prayed and prayed,” Tennant says. “I believe things shifted because of them.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, those prayers likely proved to be the difference between life and death for Chris.</p>\n<p><strong>MIRACLES</strong></p>\n<p>John took Chris to a nearby hospital, claiming he had found her walking alongside the road. Doctors later told Chris that she had lost so much blood, she should have been dead, but somehow she was living on less blood than humanly possible.</p>\n<p>Chris’s ankles had been destroyed – the tendons, ligaments, and muscles were damaged beyond repair. Originally doctors said she would never walk again. After two operations, the prognosis was upgraded to potentially being able to walk with the assistance of a walker.</p>\n<p>“I still have the scars,” Chris says, “but I now run as a hobby, four to five miles a day.”</p>\n<p>In fact, Chris returned to college that spring, using crutches, but before the semester ended, she was walking unassisted. “The Lord did miracle after miracle,” she says. “By summer, I was walking without a limp. Although I couldn’t run yet, to see me walking, you wouldn’t know I’d been through that.”</p>\n<p>John was arrested within 24 hours of dropping Chris off at the hospital. He eventually pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a mental hospital.</p>\n<p><strong>A LACK OF PROTECTION</strong></p>\n<p>Chris later learned that church leaders had done nothing to protect her or any member of their congregation from predators. It was discovered that John had been recently released from a Florida prison. One of the women at the church had become his pen pal and he had moved to Minneapolis supposedly to be close to her, but the reality was the church was an ideal place to “hunt” for a virgin.</p>\n<p>“The church did not screen any of its volunteers,” Chris said. “A background check would have revealed the criminal history John had. I was 18 when this happened, but it could have just as easily been a younger girl.”</p>\n<p>Tennant, who served as a vice president and professor at North Central for 30 years, refers to Chris as a remarkable young woman, then and now, who through her strong faith, resiliency, and willingness to accept counsel, has fully healed emotionally and spiritually. She also forgave the perpetrator (John) and the church for its negligence.</p>\n<p>“However she had to work hard to get through that and to get healthy,” Tennant says. “Many people (who survive traumatic situations) do not do that — they don’t become whole again.”</p>\n<p>Chris is a strong advocate for churches to use established safeguards when it comes to volunteers.</p>\n<p>“When someone is a volunteer, there’s an immediate sense of safety and trust,” Chris says, “but if volunteers aren’t vetted, that trust, that is so common in our churches, could easily be misplaced.”</p>\n<p><strong>FOR THE CHURCH TODAY</strong></p>\n<p>Chris says she recommends and follows the safety guidelines that Richard Hammar, the legal counsel for the Assemblies of God, espouses, including: a person must attend the church for six months before they can volunteer, complete an application form, have a national background check conducted, have references which the church actually checks, be interviewed by church leadership, and always function on the rule of three — no volunteer is ever alone with a child (for a more thorough discussion on Hammar’s recommendations, <a href=\"https://influencemagazine.com/en/Practice/Addressing-the-Risk-of-Child-Abuse\">click here</a>).</p>\n<p>Although the physical protection of young and old is of paramount importance, Tennant also points out the spiritual costs. For example, this particular church had a Satanist teaching young children how to live. Or in other situations, where a volunteer abuses a child, a child may later turn his or her back on God due to unresolved trauma — a case where a negligent church becomes the stumbling block for a soul.</p>\n<p>Chris’ testimony is one of multiple miracles, but today her concern and compassion is for others.</p>\n<p>“If someone reads this story and due to it they implement safety and security measures in their church, that would be amazing to me,” she states. “You never know how many children’s lives could be spared trauma from that decision.”</p>\n<p>Chris, who is now known as Dr. Chris Corbett, an ordained AG minister and the Chair of the School of Ministry and Theology at <a href=\"https://www.seu.edu/\">Southeastern University</a> in Lakeland, Florida, has a long history in children’s ministries. Prior to serving at SEU, she was a children’s pastor at two different AG churches, a district children’s ministry leader, and she also served as the director for the Center for Children’s and Family Ministry at North Central University. She and her husband, Anthony, have two adult children.</p>\n<p>To read the full article click <a href=\"https://news.ag.org/Features/Protecting-the-Flock-Child-Safety-Measures-Matter\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <h2>Part 2: Cash Management</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/church-cash-reserves/\">Part 1</a> of this series discussed the need to prepare your church for the unexpected and build cash reserves. This article shares important considerations when looking for ways to grow your church cash reserves.</p>\n<h4><strong>Steward the Gifts</strong></h4>\n<p>It may seem obvious for church leaders, but the most important thing to consider when investing church money is being a wise steward of the finances your church members have given. Hard-earned money is given as tithes and offerings, and church leadership has responsibility for these funds.</p>\n<h4><strong>Identify Investment Goals</strong></h4>\n<p>Before choosing an investment option or financial institution to partner with, you should first ask yourself (and your church board) several questions to better understand your needs and goals. This will greatly help when selecting where to invest your funds.</p>\n<p>Here is a list of questions to get you started:</p>\n<p><strong>Does the church have an emergency fund?</strong> If not, you should build enough cash reserves to cover an adequate number of months’ worth of expenses.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you want to earn more on church cash reserves than traditional options offer?</strong> Assuming the church has cash reserves, as mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/church-cash-reserves/\">Part 1</a> of this series consider placing funds in an interest-bearing investment with adequate liquidity, such as <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/investments/\">AGFinancial Demand Certificates.</a></p>\n<p><strong>How quickly might you need the invested cash? </strong>Understand your need for liquidity before landing on an investment option. If liquidity is not a major factor, you can invest in term investments (maturing at a designated time), and stagger the invested amounts using the laddering strategy. Laddering is an investment approach that allows you to invest portions of your investments in such a way that investments mature at different times. Think of each individual investment as a rung on a ladder. As each rung on the ladder approaches maturity, you have the option to consider the current interest rates and whether to reinvest. In this way, laddering can provide predictable access to funds while matching optimal yields with timing of cash needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you looking to expand church facilities in the next 2 years? </strong>When considering ways to finance a church construction or remodel project, the strongest source of funds is cash on hand. Create a goal to raise a specific amount and work diligently to meet that goal. If additional funds are needed for the project, consider a generosity campaign and/or a church loan (link to loans landing page).</p>\n<p><strong>Is it important for church leadership to partner with a faith-based financial institution?</strong> Many leaders are not comfortable investing church cash with financial groups whose values are not aligned with the church’s values.</p>\n</p>\n<p><em>** This is not an offering to sell securities referred to herein and we are not soliciting you to purchase these securities.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <h2>Part 1: Be Prepared for the Unexpected.</h2>\n<p>Financial stability is essential for long-term growth. One key measure of financial stability is having a financial cushion—a cash reserve.</p>\n<p>A church cash reserve is not unlike our personal need for an emergency fund. An emergency fund can help offset a job loss, medical emergency, and a large range of other unexpected expenses. A healthy church cash reserve can help cover fluctuations in giving, unexpected building repairs, and other unforeseen expenses.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Building Church Cash Reserves</strong></p>\n<p>At minimum, designate 5-10% of your church budget to build your cash reserves and increase your financial health. The first goal, similar to your personal emergency fund, would be to achieve three to six months of operating costs set aside for emergencies. Once that goal is reached, continue saving towards future church goals. These goals may include adding additional community outreaches, expanding church staff, or if you are outgrowing your current facilities, you may be considering <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/stepping-forward-faith-growth/\">building or remodeling</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Investing Church Cash </strong></p>\n<p>As you continue to build your church cash reserves, recognize that you can also grow the funds by investing it. As demonstrated through the parable of the talents in Matthew 25, we are all called to be good stewards of that which we have been entrusted.</p>\n<p>Whether the decision to invest is made by the pastor or the church board, consider there is an additional fiduciary responsibility to the church to be a good steward of the funds. A best practice for churches is a low-risk approach that can provide both growth and liquidity.

We understand the importance of volunteers; that's why our AGFinancial Insurance team has compiled a list of <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/insurance/\">risk management</a> pro tips that will help you plan and prepare for this action-packed volunteer season.</p>\n<div><strong>Here are a few important tips when it comes to managing volunteers: </strong></div>\n<h3><strong>Appoint a Volunteer Coordinator</strong></h3>\n<p>Managing volunteers doesn't have to be hectic. Assigning someone the role of interviewing potential volunteers, organizing paperwork, and placing the volunteers is the first successful step in an impactful event.</p>\n<h3><strong>Interview Your Volunteer</strong></h3>\n<p>Although it can be time-consuming, each volunteer should complete a written application and have a background check completed. Volunteers should provide references that will be checked by the Volunteer Coordinator. </p>\n<h3><strong>Match the Role With the Ability</strong></h3>\n<p>When assigning volunteers to a job, make sure to place people with the skill level and the ability to complete the position; this improves safety and increases the likelihood of having a successful event.</p>\n<h3><strong>Manage Volunteer Risk</strong></h3>\n<p>Creating a policy with best practice examples and communicating that policy is necessary. Here are a few best practice examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Two staff/volunteer members must accompany children at all times</li>\n<li>If a minor is volunteering, pair with an adult/staff member</li>\n<li>Thoroughly inspect all equipment before use</li>\n<li>Provide proper safety equipment (<em>g.</em>, goggles, gloves, etc.)</li>\n<li>Ensure all volunteer/staff members have the appropriate training to operate vehicles, rides and equipment, and have signed a driver release form, if applicable.</li>\n<li>Check that all outside vendors have proper insurance and request a certificate of insurance from every vendor that is used for the event.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Create a Backup Plan</strong></h3>\n<p>Keep the weather in consideration for the safety of your volunteers, staff, and event attendees. It is best to postpone outdoor events when bad weather arises. Always have a weather plan in place. <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/staff-volunteers-resource-kit\"><strong><br /></strong></a></p>\n<p>For more information regarding volunteers in the church, click <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid108689how-to-utilize-volunteers-without-raising-church-risk/\"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>\n<p>Contact us at 866.662.8210 or <a href=\"mailto:info@agfinancialinsurance.org\"><strong>info@agfinancialinsurance.org</strong></a> for information about obtaining proper insurance coverage for your ministry.</p>\n<p><em>This information is not legal advice.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>April was Financial Literacy month and we wanted to see how literate the average person is related to finances, so we created a quiz and many of you took it. If you took the quiz and are reading this, THANK YOU for participating. We had fun with it, and it gave us an idea of what things people know about and also where there may be some confusion.</p>\n<p>At AGFinancial, we love helping people gain a better understanding of finances and how to live a financially healthy life. With that in mind, we thought it would be good to highlight questions that left some scratching their heads. Below we reveal the three most commonly missed questions and share our answers.</p>\n<h3>How much should I save for medical expenses in retirement?</h3>\n<p>Planning for healthcare costs in retirement can be tricky. As you can imagine, there are many factors based on age, overall health, and healthcare expense trends. While the answer will be different for everyone, the average retired couple age 65 or older needs approximately $285,000* saved to cover health care costs even when on Medicare. If you retire prior to age 65 (Medicare eligibility), you will need even more for medical expense coverage. When looking at all expenses in retirement, healthcare is typically the largest expense.</p>\n<h3>How long should I wait to retire?</h3>\n<p>If the answer to this question was easy, it wouldn’t have made this list. Each individual needs to consider a few factors when answering this big question – desire to retire, current and future retirement savings, and life expectancy.</p>\n<p>From a purely financial perspective, the longer you wait to pull the trigger on retiring and drawing Social Security, the better. But how long should you wait? If you are able to defer claiming Social Security benefits until age 70, you will be able to receive the maximum increased benefit. Click <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/oact/quickcalc/early_late.html\">here</a> for the Social Security Benefits calculator.</p>\n<p>But how can you hold off that long? Planning now and making consistent contributions to a <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/\">retirement</a> plan could provide the flexibility you may need later to delay your Social Security claims and allow you to reach your maximum benefit payment.</p>\n<h3>How much life insurance should I have?</h3>\n<p>Nearly half of the people that took this quiz did not know how much life insurance they needed based on their annual salary. Many thought an amount equal to double their annual salary would be sufficient coverage, however, the basic rule of thumb suggests coverage be 10 times your annual salary.</p>\n<p>Life insurance can help take care of your family and loved ones so it is important to know how much you need. The amount of life insurance needed can vary greatly depending on how many dependents you have, how old you are, and how much debt you have. When looking at life insurance, consider the basic needs of paying off debt and covering all expenses for at least one year. From there, you may also want to consider covering college expenses for your children and paying off your home and vehicles.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>If you are considering purchasing an indexed annuity, please read the following article carefully. And remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</p>\n<h5><strong>FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) has issued an <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/InvestorDocument/p125847.pdf\">Investor Alert</a> on Equity-Indexed Annuities.</strong></h5>\n</p>\n<p>Here are five important things you need to know about indexed annuities:</p>\n<h4><strong>It’s Insurance.</strong></h4>\n<p>An indexed annuity is an insurance product. Before even considering purchasing one as an alternative retirement investment, research the details thoroughly and make sure you understand the risks, fees, how returns are calculated, and when and how you can make withdrawals and what they will cost you.</p>\n<h4><strong>Low Yield</strong>.</h4>\n<p>These products are often advertised as having zero downside risk, but with the ability to capture the upswings of the stock market. Be aware there are several ways your upside returns can be reduced. For instance, if the market goes up, the annuity will often not pay that same rate of increase as there will be a limitation of the increase in the form of a performance cap. This cap is set by the insurance company and can be changed according to their policies, and you have no recourse when this happens. Any performance increase above the cap is not paid to the annuity, but rather kept to profit the company. There are also participation rates and spreads that can reduce the yield.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/retirement/considering-indexed-annuities\">Fidelity Investments report</a> shows that over the 10 years ending December 31, 2018, the S&P 500 average annual return was 13.12%. The representative indexed annuity illustrated in the report, using a monthly cap of 1.50% and monthly point-to-point crediting method, returned only 3.53% annually, despite a guaranteed annual floor of 0%, and despite an 8% bonus that may be offered. As a comparison, during that same 10-year period, the MBA Income Fund averaged 4.65%.*</p>\n<h4><strong>Increased Fees and Commissions</strong>.</h4>\n<p>While it is true that most indexed annuities have no up-front sales charges, they often are upsold with additional riders. For example, several insurance companies will offer a guaranteed living withdrawal benefit at an average annual cost of nearly 1% of the account value. In addition, if you change your mind or find a better-suited investment opportunity during your long surrender period, you can be hit with severe penalties and possibly even lose principal. Indexed annuities can charge more than 9% in a surrender penalty if you move out of the contract within a certain number of years.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that high commission rates of up to 10% may influence insurance agents to act in their own self-interests, rather than considering what’s best for their prospective client.</p>\n</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Having been in the insurance industry for over 30 years, I am very familiar with indexed annuities. They are complex and while most individuals do not understand them, even some agents don’t understand them except that they pay a higher commission, incentivizing them to offer them. Also, you need to look at the insurance company’s ratings, and don’t even think about considering a company that doesn’t have the highest ratings.</em></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><em>Jerry Sparks, President<br />\nAGFinancial Insurance</em></p></blockquote>\n<h4><strong>Difficult to Understand. </strong></h4>\n<p>The typical annuity contract can be hard to read and understand. It should clearly state what the performance of the annuity is correlated to, such as the performance of the S&P 500. In addition, the contract should be written such that the expected yield, surrender charges, and other fees are easily found and understood.</p>\n<h4><strong>Aggressive selling</strong>.</h4>\n<p>Do not allow yourself to be pressured. Insurance agents may use various tactics to encourage the purchase of an indexed annuity, such as targeting seniors or promising features that may or may not be accurate. For example, if an agent says that ministers housing allowance is available for the annuity, be sure to ask questions to ensure you don’t forfeit this valuable benefit. How much experience and knowledge does the agent have with the complex nature of ministers housing allowance? Have you researched the organization that is acting as the authority to establish the housing allowance? Make sure to protect your hard-earned money by obtaining appropriate written documentation confirming the inclusion of the ministers housing allowance with any product you purchase.</p>\n<p>In addition to our own concerns about annuities, other familiar sources fly similar warning flags:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/money/investing/info-2017/fixed-index-annuities-jbq.html\">AARP</a> - Dream Investment or Potential Nightmare?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/feeonlyplanner/2018/01/20/do-not-invest-in-an-equity-indexed-annuity/#3ea474a71f45\">Forbes</a></strong> <strong>- Do Not Invest in an Equity-Indexed Annuity</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/retirement/considering-indexed-annuities?&imm_pid=700000001009653&immid=100662&imm_eid=ep13914535666&msclkid=1b70424af5c81134840f1e01bb992a8c&gclid=CMCV2J7BieACFYeIxQId4ZQJVw&gclsrc=ds\">Fidelity</a> - Indexed annuities: Look before you leap</strong></p>\n<p>If after your thorough research you are still thinking about buying an indexed annuity, be sure to first seek professional advice from a qualified and experienced professional.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>If you made New Year’s resolutions, there’s a good chance one of them has to do with finances or organization. This article addresses valuable financial tips that will help you get better control of your finances by implementing organization into your budget. Consider it a two-for-one.</p>\n<h3><strong>Assess and Refine Your Budget</strong></h3>\n<p>This may not seem like new advice, but even if you already have a working budget, it’s worthwhile to look at it with fresh eyes as the year begins. Ask yourself the following questions:</p>\n<p><strong>Does my budget support my financial goals?<br />\n</strong>Take time to write down your financial goals and then build monthly allocations into your budget. While vacations and significant purchases may be on your list, make sure you also establish goals for an emergency fund and retirement.</p>\n<p><strong>Are my tax needs factored into my budget?<br />\n</strong>Nobody likes getting a tax bill at the end of the year, but a large refund isn’t necessarily a better alternative. It may feel nice to get a sudden influx of money, but that is money you could be earning interest on as you set it aside to reach your goals faster. Try to find a balance between the two and minimize your refund.</p>\n<p><strong>Is my budget written down?<br />\n</strong>You can do this with apps, spreadsheets, or pen and paper. It doesn’t have to be sophisticated. Just make sure to designate a category for every dollar earned and spent. Don't forget to include infrequent expenses such as oil changes, property taxes, and even Christmas gifts.</p>\n<p><strong>Do I live by my budget?<br />\n</strong>A budget should be firm enough to keep you on track toward your goals but flexible enough to allow for unexpected expenses. If you get off track, it’s important to get back to the budget right away. Getting off track is a learning opportunity. Use it to assess your budget and see where you might be able to cut back in order to save money for any future unforeseen events.</p>\n<h3><strong>Save Smart</strong></h3>\n<p>This year, don’t just save more, save smart. The point of saving money is to reach financial goals faster. One very easy way to save smart is to put your money where you'll earn a higher interest rate than what you'll typically find with a standard savings account at a bank or credit union.</p>\n<p>Contrary to what many think, you don’t have to have a lot of money to start. For example,<strong><u><a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/investments/types-of-investments\"> AGLF Demand Investment Certificates</a>*</u></strong> can be opened with a minimum investment of $250.</p>\n<h3>Plan for Retirement</h3>\n<p><strong>Open a Retirement Account.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong>If you have access to an employer account, such as a 401(k) or 403(b), set one up. If you’re an AG minister or AG ministry employee click here to learn more about our fellowship’s official <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/403b/\">403(b) plan</a>. Alternatively, you can contribute to an Individual Retirement Account (<a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/investments/ira/\">IRA</a>). There are several different types of IRAs including Traditional, Roth, and Simplified Employee Pension (SEP), which is a great option for the self-employed. Learn more about the differences <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/traditional-vs-roth-iras-what-you-need-to-know/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Read More: <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/the-millionaire-retirement-standard/\">The Millionaire Retirement Standard</a></p>\n<p><strong>Make regular contributions.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong>Get an idea of how much you’ll need to save with these easy <strong><a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/calculators/\">retirement calculators</a></strong>. Make budget allocations accordingly. The most painless way to save for retirement is to have contributions automatically deducted from your income. You may be pleasantly surprised and find that you don't even miss that money.</p>\n<p><strong>Increase your contributions over time.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong>It’s absolutely okay to start small, but make it your goal to increase the amount little by little. If your employer offers matching contributions, try to build up your amount until you’re taking full advantage of this benefit.</p>\n<p>These resolutions will help you build a stable financial future.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>IRAs can be a great way to save for retirement and plan for tax savings. Traditional IRAs are available to everyone regardless of income, but Roth IRAs may offer additional flexibility if you are eligible.</p>\n<p>Both types of accounts provide tax breaks and allow earnings to grow tax-free, but the traditional IRA and the Roth IRA each have their own benefits and disadvantages, depending on your financial situation. The biggest difference between the traditional and a Roth IRA is when the taxes will be paid—now or later.</p>\n<p>With a traditional IRA, contributions are made pre-tax (typically with an up-front tax deduction). This means that you won’t have to pay income taxes on your earnings and contributions until you begin taking distributions, usually after you retire. You are required to begin taking distributions from a traditional IRA by April 1 following the year in which you turn 70½.</p>\n<p>In contrast, a Roth IRA is funded with money for which you have already paid taxes, thus withdrawals of earnings are tax-free for qualified distributions. This type of account allows more access as you are able to withdraw <em>contributions</em> at any time without a penalty. Roth IRAs do have <a href=\"http://agfinancial.org/investments/IRA\">income-eligibility limits</a> *, but unlike a traditional IRA there is no requirement to start taking distributions at a certain age. So not only can you let it continue to grow after age 70½, you can also continue to contribute with earned compensation. A Roth can be a plus for those over age 70 who plan to continue working.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional withdrawal rules</strong><br />\nYou may withdraw money from a traditional IRA at any time, but in most cases there will be a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty if you take money out before age 59½.</p>\n<p>If you withdraw <em>earnings</em> from a Roth IRA before age 59½, and before you’ve reached the five year holding period, that money will be subject both to income taxes and a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty.</p>\n<p>There are some exceptions to the early withdrawal penalties above; generally, you may withdraw from either IRA penalty-free before age 59½ in order to buy your first home, pay for higher education or certain significant medical costs, or because of disability or death. These withdrawals would still be subject to taxes for the traditional IRA.</p>\n<p><strong>Dual IRAs</strong><br />\nYou may find it advantageous to have both a traditional and Roth IRA. Having the flexibility to mix your withdrawals from both a traditional IRA (which will increase your taxable income) and from a pre-taxed Roth IRA may help you manage your overall tax liability.</p>\n<p>If you would like more information on opening an IRA, contact us today at 888.616.5243.</p>\n<p><em>*If your income is over the IRA income limits for a Roth IRA, you may be able to convert eligible assets such as a traditional IRA into a Roth.

IRAs are a fantastic way to fund or supplement your retirement savings, as they provide a variety of ways to make contributions, as well as options to meet your specific tax needs.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t already done so, now is the time to fund your traditional IRA to reap tax benefits for the 2018 taxable year. Making a deductible contribution to your retirement account may help lower your tax bill, and, in addition, contributions will compound tax-deferred. That means that you won’t have to pay income taxes on the funds in your traditional IRA until you begin taking distributions in retirement.</p>\n<p>For 2018, the maximum IRA contribution is $5,500. If you are age 50 or over by the end of the year, you can contribute an additional $1,000 for a total of $6,500. All contributions must be made before the tax filing due date—April 15, 2019.</p>\n<p>If you choose to make your IRA contribution after January 1, be sure to let your financial institution know the year to which you would like the contribution applied.

Here are a few ways to ease some of the stress when it comes to utilizing volunteers.</p>\n<p>Although it can be time consuming, make sure all of your volunteers:</p>\n<p>- Complete a written application</p>\n<p>- Go through an interview process with the appropriate personnel</p>\n<p>- Have a background check processed</p>\n<p>Be sure that you check references for each volunteer and keep that documentation on file. Before the event, take steps to train and equip your volunteers to ensure they are capable in their assigned task, and reassign them if necessary. In addition, create a policy for the event including these best practice examples, and make sure that it is followed:</p>\n<p>- Children must be accompanied by two staff/volunteer members at all times</p>\n<p>- If a minor is volunteering, they need to be paired with an adult volunteer/staff member</p>\n<p>- Ensure all equipment is thoroughly inspected before use</p>\n<p>- Depending on the event, provide safety equipment and first aid (e.g., goggles, gloves, etc.)</p>\n<p>- Ensure the volunteer/staff member has the proper training to operate vehicles, rides, etc.</p>\n<p>Lastly, when planning for your event, keep the weather in consideration for the safety of your volunteers, staff, and event attendees. It is best to postpone outdoor events when bad weather may occur. In any case, make sure to have a plan in place in the event that bad weather occurs.</p>\n<p>For more information regarding volunteers in the church click <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid108689how-to-utilize-volunteers-without-raising-church-risk/\">here.</a></p>\n<p>Contact us at <span>866.662.8210 </span>or <a href=\"mailto:info@agfinancialinsurance.org\">info@agfinancialinsurance.org</a> for information about obtaining proper insurance coverage for your ministry.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

For instance, based on an average inflation rate of 3.5%, prices would double every 20 years. Or to put it another way, $1,000 today may only have the spending power of $500 in 20 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Medical Costs</strong><br />\nHealth costs tend to rise as you get older. Even with healthcare benefits, a healthy 65-year-old couple could spend upwards of $250,000 on out-of-pocket medical expenses. Medical expenses are typically the biggest and most unpredictable retirement expense.</p>\n<p><strong>Lifestyle Expenses</strong><br />\nWhat do you want to do in retirement? Travel? Spend time with family? Estimate the costs associated with your desired lifestyle because how you spend money in retirement may be more important than how much you have saved for retirement.</p>\n<p><strong>What can you do now?</strong><br />\nFirst, you will want to <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/calculators/\" rel=\"noopener\">estimate </a> your retirement savings needs.

Would it be difficult for someone to determine the year you graduated high school or locate your wedding anniversary date? Such information is frequently used as answers to your security questions.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Planning for your financial future should involve thinking about your legacy—how you will provide for your family and how to maximize your life’s impact on the things that matter most to you. Your legacy will be reflected in your children and grandchildren, in your work, and in the causes and organizations you choose to support with your time and finances.</p>\n<p>Donating money or assets to ministry is one of the simplest ways to have an impact, but figuring out where to start with your giving can often be a challenge. Planned giving offers a solution. By creating a plan for long-term giving, you can support the growth of the ministries and causes that matter to you, while also providing for you and your family. Even if you think that you don’t have much to give, the right giving tool can help you create an income stream while also allowing you to donate to the ministries of your choice.</p>\n<p>Some planned giving options are straightforward and allow you to designate a charitable organization to receive money upon your death. Other gifts require a little more planning and can provide you with lifetime income streams, potential capital gains and immediate tax deductions, as well as the chance to give to ministry.</p>\n<p>The funds you allocate for a planned gift may be given to a ministry or charitable organization over time or after your lifetime, depending on the type of gift. Your planned gift may be created with cash or an outright gift of assets, such as real estate or appreciated stocks.</p>\n<p>One of the many benefits of a planned gift is that it can be designed to meet your specific needs, helping you organize your giving and make financial plans for the support of your loved ones. There are a variety of tools you can use to achieve your giving goals.</p>\n<p>A Donor Advised Fund (DAF) works like your personal savings fund. You contribute money or assets to the fund, receive an immediate tax deduction, and then recommend distributions to charities or ministries. The funds in a DAF grow tax-free, generating even more money for donations. With a DAF, you have the ability to do all or a portion of your charitable giving through one simple fund.</p>\n<p>A Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT) creates a lifetime income stream for you and your spouse, as well as a third party, for a term of up to 20 years. This highly customizable trust can be funded with cash, appreciated stocks, bonds, and a variety of other assets, such as land and real estate. A CRT provides an immediate tax deduction, as well as a potential capital gains tax savings. At the end of the term or the death of the last beneficiary, the remaining assets are then distributed to the charitable organization or ministry of your choice.</p>\n<p>A Charitable Gift Annuity (CGA) enables you to receive fixed payments for life and give generously to ministry. You transfer cash or securities and in exchange, you receive fixed payments for life. A portion of your income stream may even be tax-free and you will receive a tax deduction on the good portion of the annuity.</p>\n<p>With an Endowment, you can create a lasting legacy that will a provide a continual blessing to ministry beyond your lifetime. Endowments can be a great way not only to support the ministries that matter most to you, but also allows you the opportunity to establish scholarships that impact the future through education. This tool allows you and others to continue to add assets to the fund, and payments to ministry are made from the ongoing interest and provide funding for an unlimited number of years.</p>\n<p>If you are unable to find a single gift option to meet your specific needs, you can combine planned giving tools into what’s known as a blended gift. A blended gift can help you see the impact of your giving today, while continuing to provide support for your chosen ministries in the future.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in finding the right tools to meet your financial, tax, estate planning, and ministry goals, our consultants make it easy to find the planned giving solution to fit your specific needs.</p>\n<p>Contact us at 877.616.5202 or <a href=\"mailto: plannedgiving@agfinancial.org\">email</a> us to start the conversation or simply to learn more about planned giving. We look forward to helping you plan your legacy.</p>\n<p><em>Gift Annuities are available in most states, but there are a few exceptions.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>How much thought have you given to planning for retirement? If you’re like most people we’ve talked to, you haven’t thought about retirement as much as you should. But a little planning can go a long way in preparing you for a financially secure future. Here are five retirement strategies you should adopt ASAP.</p>\n<p><strong>Start Saving Now</strong><br />\nWith compound interest, the more time you have, the more your money will grow. Someone who starts saving for retirement at 25 will have to contribute a much smaller amount to their account than someone who begins saving at 45. It’s a simple concept, but an essential one: the earlier you start saving, the better off you’ll be in the future. No matter what your age, the right time to start saving for retirement is now. Use our <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/calculators/\">calculator</a> to estimate how much money you’ll need for retirement.</p>\n<p><strong>Save a Little More</strong><br />\nIf you’ve only been able to save 3% of your income toward retirement, challenge yourself to bump your savings up to 4%. Determine ways you can set aside a little more money each month. A few extra dollars may not seem like much, but consistently boosting how much you save can help you reach your retirement goals in the long run. Check out our <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/52-ways-to-save-ebook/\" rel=\"noopener\">52 Ways to Save Ebook</a> to help you set aside some extra funds for retirement.</p>\n<p><strong>Put Away the Extra</strong><br />\nWhen you receive a bonus at work or a tax refund, make plans to invest at least half of that money in your retirement account. It can be tempting to spend that extra money on a trip or vacation, but your future self will thank you for saving it. Even just an extra $1,000 every year can contribute a significant amount to your retirement savings.</p>\n<p><strong>Be a Smart Spender</strong><br />\nThe best way to save money is to keep track of every dollar. By monitoring where your money goes, you can be more aware of how much you have and make wiser purchasing decisions. Be more cognizant of what you’re spending and focus on building long-term wealth for your future.</p>\n<p><strong>Roll Over Old Retirement Accounts</strong><br />\nInstead of cashing out or collecting old retirement plans, <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/403b/#rollovers\" rel=\"noopener\">roll the funds</a> over into a single account. Having all your retirement savings in one place can help give you a better picture of the progress you’ve made toward your saving goals. As an added bonus, you may also save money by getting rid of maintenance fees that often accompany retirement saving accounts.</p>\n<p>Have you developed a plan for your retirement? Take some time to focus on what you need to retire and get started today. And if you need help planning your retirement strategy, contact us at 877.616.5204 or <a href=\"mailto:retirement@agfinancial.org\" rel=\"noopener\">retirement@agfinancial.org</a>.</p>\n<p><em>This information is not legal or tax advice.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Everyone dreams of retiring comfortably, but are you working toward that dream today? If you don’t start saving now, you may struggle to cover your living expenses once you’re retired.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/planners/lifeexpectancy.html\" rel=\"noopener\">Social Security Administration</a>, one out of every four 65-year-olds alive today will live past age 90, and one out of every 10 will live past 95. A longer average life expectancy means a longer average retirement. Once you retire, you may have to cover your living expenses for decades.</p>\n<p>Below are five ways you can boost your retirement savings and get your future on track.</p>\n<p><strong>Take Advantage of Employer-Sponsored Plans</strong><br />\nAn employer-provided retirement plan allows you to contribute pre-tax funds, which can be a major advantage, as it enables you to invest more of your income without drastically altering your monthly budget. If your employer offers a match, be sure to contribute enough to take full advantage. A match is essentially free money, so don’t pass it up.</p>\n<p>For ministers and ministry employees, our<a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/403b/\" rel=\"noopener\"> MBA 403(b) Retirement Plan</a> offers a variety of self-directed investment strategies, including index funds, actively-managed funds, target-date strategies, risk-based strategies, and our proprietary MBA Income Fund, which has provided a stable return to participants for over 60 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Consider Adding an IRA</strong><br />\nMany people don’t realize that you can contribute both to a workplace retirement plan and an <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/ira/\" rel=\"noopener\">IRA</a>. Doing so allows you to save more money for retirement.</p>\n<p>A traditional IRA and a Roth IRA are the most common plans, and each has their own benefits. Learn more about which type of IRA might be right for you <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/traditional-vs-roth-ira-right/\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.<br />\n<strong><br />\nSet Up Automatic Contributions</strong><br />\nAs with any savings plan, the best way to set money aside for the future is to pay yourself first. By automating your monthly contributions to your retirement account, you can avoid the temptation to spend the money designated for your savings on something else.</p>\n<p><strong>Create Saving Goals</strong><br />\nDevelop goals for your retirement savings to help keep you on track. Use a <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/calculators/\" rel=\"noopener\">calculator</a> to estimate how much you’ll need for retirement and set goals along the way. Reaching a smaller goal can give you a sense of accomplishment and motivate you to keep reaching for your larger savings goal.</p>\n<p><strong>Find Ways to Save More Money</strong><br />\nTake a close look at your budget and identify any areas where you can cut back on spending. <a href=\"http://www.agfinancial.org/blog/52-ways-to-save-ebook/\">Click here</a> to read 52 Ways to Save. In addition, every time you receive a raise, increase your retirement contribution by a percentage. And anytime you earn a bonus or receive a tax refund or other extra money, consider dedicating those funds to your retirement plan.</p>\n<p>Another way to free up more money for retirement is to work on paying off debt. If you’re only making the minimum payments on your credit cards or loans, you’re losing money in interest that could be going to fund your retirement savings. Try to pay extra each month, and once your credit card balances are paid off, make sure to pay the balance in full every month from then on.</p>\n<p>Saving enough money to support you in retirement may seem like a challenging goal, but with planning, you can accomplish it. And, thanks to compound interest, the earlier you begin saving for retirement, the better off you will be. Start saving today for your future.</p>\n<p><em>This information is not legal or tax advice.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>It's easy to think about retirement as something far off that doesn't affect you today. But if you don't plan strategically for retirement now, you may not have enough to support yourself as you age. Below are some smart strategies to keep your retirement planning on track:</p>\n<p><strong>Strategy #1: Go long!</strong><br />\nMost people are more concerned with the next few months than the years and decades to come. It's easy to focus on the immediate issues of paying bills and expenses, but short-term thinking won't help you down the road.</p>\n<p>Long-term thinking begins with the future and works its way back to the present. Picture yourself at 70, 80, and 90. What will your needs be at that age? What would you like to be able to do? Once you figure out your goals for retirement, consider what you should be doing now to prepare for your future. To help with this goal, we've provided various <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/calculators/\">calculators</a> to help determine how much you will need to save for retirement.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategy #2: Avoid cashing out</strong><br />\nOne of the biggest mistakes you can make is cashing out your retirement plan when you leave a job. While it can be tempting to simply cash out your retirement, an early withdrawal can really hurt your saving strategy. Not only does cashing out reduce your savings for the future, but there are financial penalties for early withdrawals. If you take money out of your retirement account before age 59½, you will have to pay a 10% penalty. Forty-five percent of people who switch jobs before age 59½ <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/07/dont-sink-your-retirement-by-cashing-out-your-401k-plan.html\">cash out</a> their retirement plans, and while many may intend to return the funds to their accounts, life often gets in the way and prevents them from doing so.</p>\n<p>The better option is to <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/combine-simplify-retirement-savings/\">roll your retirement account</a> from a previous job over into your new qualified plan or IRA. This way, you don't lose any of the money you have saved up for the future, and it can continue to grow, along with your new contributions.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategy #3: Know your risk level</strong><br />\nSaving for retirement is not something you can accomplish overnight. It takes planning, determination, and commitment. It may sound appealing to jump on the latest promising investment, but doing so can do you more harm than good.</p>\n<p>Before making a decision to invest simply for higher returns, seek the advice of a financial professional. It's important to remember that higher returns are generally accompanied by higher risk. Know your financial goals and how much risk you're personally willing to take, so you can develop an investment portfolio that matches your <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/biggest-mistakes-investors-make-part-3/\">tolerance for risk</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategy #4: Prioritize savings, then debt</strong><br />\nEliminating debt is an important part of developing financial stability, but it's only one piece of good financial management. Many people feel that they can't work on saving money until their debt is paid off. But unfortunately, most people end up not saving the extra money in their budget once their debts are eliminated. To create a strong foundation, balance your savings goals while eliminating high interest debt.</p>\n<p>Saving for retirement can be a daunting prospect, especially when those years feel so far away. But if you shift your short-term thinking to long-term thinking and make saving a priority, you can take the first steps on the path to financial stability. Your future self will thank you.</p>\n<p><em>This information is not legal or tax advice. Information is from sources deemed reliable.

    "excerpt": "Overestimating Your Tolerance for Risk .",
    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p><strong>Overestimating Your Tolerance for Risk</strong>.</p>\n<p>In the final part of this 3-part series, we sat down with Kyle Dana, AGFinancial’ senior vice president of Retirement and Investments, to hear his insights and answers to common questions regarding investing.</p>\n<p>Q: In the <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/biggest-mistakes-investors-make/\">first part</a> of this series, you shared about the role of emotions in relation to investing. What else do people need to consider when looking at investment options?</p>\n<p>A: Risk is a general area investors need to know more about—both understanding what risk is, as well as understanding their personal tolerance level for it. Risk is defined as exposure to the chance of loss. Risk is not about how high your possible returns would be, but rather about understanding your potential for loss as well as gain. It is important to understand the relationship between risk and reward; the bigger the possible reward, the larger the risk.</p>\n<p>It’s easy for investors to get too focused on returns and lose sight of the involved risk. Remember that if your investment has the potential to make 20% in the market, it also may have the potential to lose 20% or more. The Great Recession of 2008-2009 had two significant positives: 1) it reminded us that the market is unpredictable, and 2) it provided buying opportunities. The irony is that because investors had not properly understood their own risk, the Great Recession left them scared and paralyzed.</p>\n<p>Q: How should an investor determine how much risk they can handle?</p>\n<p>A: You’ve heard the quote, “you’re your own worst enemy.” This can be especially true when it comes to investment portfolios and not making decisions based on your risk tolerance. <a href=\"https://www.calcxml.com/calculators/inv08\">This quiz</a> is a generic example of the variety of quizzes available online to help investors identify their risk level.</p>\n<p>Determining your risk tolerance is not a one-time-only event. Your risk tolerance level in your 20s may not be the same in your 40s. Your tolerance for risk can shift due to age, changes in family status, income, etc., and therefore should be assessed periodically.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, you have to know your financial objectives and understand how much risk you’re willing to take. Focus on developing a diversified portfolio that matches your risk tolerance level.</p>\n<p>Q: You mentioned knowing when risk is and is not okay. Can you expand on that?</p>\n<p>A: The industry often determines how much risk you could take based on time. For example, the further away from retirement you are, the more risk they would suggest you take. And conversely, the closer to retirement you are, the less risk they may suggest you take. While this is an acceptable generality, in my opinion, investment decisions should be based more on personality. For instance, the industry may advise an investor in their 30s to take more risk. But if that 30-year-old has a personality that is more risk-averse, they would most likely panic and overreact to market downturns which could cause more harm to their portfolio than if they had invested according to their personality (less risk).</p>\n<p>If you are nearing retirement age, I would urge that you be very careful with risk. Work with a trusted advisor when thinking about reallocating your investments. A market correction could be devastating at a time when you can least afford a loss. You simply may not have adequate time to allow your investments to recover.</p>\n<p>For those looking for less-risk, a popular investment option within the AG 403(b) is the fixed rate <a href=\"http://files.agfinancial.org/Retirement/Fund-Descriptors/MBA-Income-Fund.pdf\">MBA Income Fund</a>, with a stable rate of return since inception more than 60 years ago. As of July 31, 2017, the annualized return since inception is 6.65%.</p>\n<p>Final Thought:<br />\nUltimately, investor choices can do the most damage to a portfolio. By properly evaluating your risk tolerance, you can reduce the likelihood of making poor investment decisions.</p>\n<p><strong><em>If you’re an <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/403b/\">AG 403(b)</a> participant, familiarize yourself with the investment options available within the plan. From the MBA Income Fund to the multiple stock strategies, there are <a href=\"http://files.agfinancial.org/retirement/Performance-Update/Performance-Update.pdf\">investment options</a> within the plan for all risk tolerance levels. </em></strong></p>\n<p>Click <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/biggest-mistakes-investors-make/\">here</a> to read Part 1 of this series, Investing with Your Emotions.<br />\nClick <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/biggest-mistakes-investors-make-part-2/\">here</a> to read Part 2 of this series, Focusing on Timing Instead of Time.</p>\n<p><em>This information is not legal, financial, or tax advice.

Websites like Facebook offer a free, easy way to promote church events and strengthen your community outside of Sunday services.</p>\n<p>However, misusing social media, even if unintended, can damage your ministry’s reputation and even put your church at risk of litigation. In order to enjoy the benefits of social media while also protecting against possible misuse, it’s wise to develop a <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid97988creating-a-social-media-policy-for-your-church/\">social media policy</a> for your church or ministry.</p>\n<p>Below are a few subjects to consider including in your church’s social media policy:</p>\n<p>Do not share personally identifiable information. Remember that social media is public and can be viewed by anyone, even if they are not a member of your church. Protect the children in your church by keeping their information private—never post birthdates, phone numbers, or school names. If you wish to share photos of minors, always seek written permission from parents or guardians. Make sure that photos don’t include items that might be used to identify others, such as street signs, house numbers, or vehicle license plates.</p>\n<p>Be aware of copyright laws. It’s illegal to use articles, photos, music, or other materials without obtaining permission first. Simply naming the original author is not adequate. In order to legally post copyrighted material, like a video of a worship service containing copyrighted music, you must have proper authorization, either through a license the church holds or directly from the owner of the material.</p>\n<p>Avoid posting information that may be confidential. Many churches make the mistake of posting prayer needs along with individuals’ names. Do not post any private facts about people or situations unless you have permission. Keep in mind that posting information about missionaries in sensitive countries or members of the military can actually put those individuals at risk.</p>\n<p>Social media is especially effective for keeping youth aware of and involved in church events. But interacting with minors online requires caution. Because all online communication is not confidential and may be shared, your staff’s interactions on social media need to be transparent.</p>\n<p>For adults who minister to youth, it can seem like a good idea to accept “friend” requests from students to keep communication open. A better solution, however, is to create a closed group that youth may join, which would help to create and maintain healthy boundaries. Online youth groups should have at least two unrelated adult administrators and should be open to parents of current members.</p>\n<p>Mark Forrester, Director of Communication and Public Relations for the General Council of the Assemblies of God and the author of <em>Trending Up: Social Media Strategies for Today’s Church</em> offers some suggestions for making the most of your church’s social media.</p>\n<p>“Church social media managers should ask themselves how they feel when they are followed by an account or when another account interacts with them or shares their posts,” Forrester said. “In turn, treat your own followers in ways that make you feel honored, respected, and engaged on other accounts. Don’t make the mistake of pushing out the same content to one channel for it to automatically feed to your other social networks. Take an extra moment to customize your content for each channel. Don’t bite off more than you can chew. Limit yourself to where you will be most effective.”</p>\n<p>Because of the risks in using social media, it’s essential to take steps to protect your church. In addition to developing a social media policy, train all employees and volunteers on the proper and improper use of social media. Be sure to monitor the church website and social media pages, as well as posts made by others.</p>\n<p>For more information on the risks and benefits of church social media use, click <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmgolEHis6I&list=PLS35Et-nHKCyBb23R2pHbuDu-YmGETdQT&index=30\">here</a> to watch this riskmgmtLIVE video on social media policies.</p>\n<p>To learn more about how to use social media effectively for your ministry, click <a href=\"http://myhealthychurch.com/store/startitem.cfm?item=027460&cat=iNEWTITLES&mastercat=&path=\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> to order Mark Forrester’s latest book, <em><em>Trending Up: Social Media Strategies for Today’s Church.</em></em></p>\n<p><em>This information is not legal advice.

    "excerpt": "Focusing on Timing Instead of Time",
    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p><strong>Focusing on Timing Instead of Time</strong></p>\n<p>In the second of a 3-part series on the biggest mistakes investors make, we sat down with Kyle Dana, AGFinancial’ senior vice president of Retirement and Investments, to hear his insights and answers to common questions regarding investing. Read Part One <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/biggest-mistakes-investors-make/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Is timing the market a bad thing?</strong></p>\n<p>A: It’s not necessarily bad if you’re doing it right all the time; it’s when you’re wrong that you hurt your performance.</p>\n<p>Let me also clarify that the type of timing we are discussing is an emotional timing; a short term reaction to news or sudden market moves. There is a disciplined form of timing which can be a useful tool. Examples of disciplined timing would be periodic rebalancing of your portfolio, or adjusting portfolio allocation based on income needs. For the purposes of discussing mistakes investors make, let’s stick to emotional timing.</p>\n<p>Peter Lynch, personal investor and former mutual fund manager once said, “Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves.”</p>\n<p><strong>To make gains in the market, time, not timing, is the best strategy.</strong> To illustrate, look at the stock market (Dow Jones Industrial Average) from 12/31/01-12/31/16. If you had stayed invested the entire time, your average annual return would have been 7.28%. On the other hand, had you tried to time the market and missed just 10 of the best days, your average annual return would have dropped to just 2.60%.<sup>†</sup> Timing can really hinder your portfolio’s performance.</p>\n<p>Here’s another example of how using time and patience can reduce your risk of loss. Over the last 30 years, 1987 to 2016, there have only been 6 years where the market (S&P 500) ended negative for the year. Furthermore, the worst rolling 20-year return of the stock market (S&P 500) between 1979 to 2016 was a positive 6.4% a year!<sup> ‡</sup> That was the worst; the best 20-year rolling return during the same time period was 18% a year! I don’t know about you, but those numbers compel me to stay the course and not get too worried about the short term fluctuations in the stock market.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why shouldn’t an investor sell when their investments decline in value?</strong></p>\n<p>A: When you buy and when you sell has a significant impact on your overall performance. Selling a long term investment when it dips is a risky, often emotionally triggered response that could lock in a loss. Let me illustrate. Let’s use a home, to which many can relate. Let’s say you have a great home, solid job, kids are in a good school and you have no reason to move. Then one day you wake up and discover all the homes in your area, including yours, have decreased in value by 25%! Would you place a “For Sale” sign in your yard? You would most likely stay put and wait for the value to increase again because you have no immediate need to move. The same principle is true for long-term investments. A drop in the value may not be a reason to sell immediately. It may actually be a reason to buy more at cheaper prices, depending on your goals and risk tolerance level. Don’t miss the final part of this investment series, <em>Overestimating Your Tolerance for Risk</em>, for a better understanding of the relationship between risk and reward. Sign up below to receive Part 3 straight to your inbox.</p>\n<p>FINAL THOUGHT: Accept that the market will go up and down in the short term. Have a long-term investment strategy and stick with it. And most of all…be patient!</p>\n<p><strong><em>If you’re an <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/403b/\">AG 403(b)</a> investor, familiarize yourself with the investment options available within the plan.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Planning for retirement involves a little number-crunching.</p>\n<p>You may know your cholesterol number or blood pressure. You have a pretty good idea of your weight and height. You probably even know the mileage on your vehicle. But do you know the numbers that will help you plan for your future?</p>\n<p><strong>How long will you live?</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db267.pdf\">Life expectancy</a> at birth in 2015 was 78.8 years. Currently, a 65-year-old man can expect to live another 18 years, whereas a 65-year-old woman can expect to live another 20 years. <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/population/longevity.html\">Click here</a> to see the U.S. life expectancy table.<br />\n<strong><br />\nAre you prepared for retirement?</strong><br />\nMany ministers are unprepared for retirement; 27% have no retirement savings at all. Among those ministers who have begun to save for retirement, 50% have less than $19,000 saved—not enough to provide for years of retirement. In addition, 86% of AG ministers have some form of debt, whether mortgage, school loans, medical, or credit card. These statistics and more can be viewed in Dr. George O. Wood’s article, <a href=\"http://listassets.ag.org/official/calledtoserve/201701/Called_to_Serve_W17.pdf\">click here</a> to read.</p>\n<p>There’s more to preparing for retirement than just saving. Retirement planning involves getting all of your finances in order, including paying off debts.</p>\n<p><strong>How much do you need to save?</strong><br />\nMany financial experts suggest saving up 10 to 12 times your annual salary for retirement, but there’s no one-size-fits-all rule. A commonly used percentage of your current salary needed to live comfortably in retirement is 70%. For example, if you made $100,000 a year before retirement, with most calculations you would be able to live comfortably on $70,000 a year during retirement. <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/calculators/\">Click here </a>to estimate what you may need based on your own situation.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that while some living expenses will decline, such as having a home paid off, other costs such as medical expenses generally increase with age. Even with health insurance, a married couple in their 60s could end up spending over $285,000 on out-of-pocket medical expenses over the course of their retirement. Other costs such as travel, ongoing home maintenance, long-term care or nursing home expenses, can quickly add up. Don’t forget that retired ministers may benefit from continuing a housing allowance tax deduction on their 403(b) distributions which can potentially offset other expenses and reduce tax liability (<a href=\"http://files.agfinancial.org/retirement/Housing-Allowance-Worksheet.pdf\">click here</a> to view the housing allowance worksheet). It’s essential to consider what factors are important to you, and have funds set aside for those events.</p>\n<p>It’s never too early to begin preparing for retirement.

For the past 11 years, AGFinancial Insurance Solutions has partnered with Church Mutual to offer the Assemblies of God Church Program, which insures nearly 4,000 AG facilities.</p>\n<p>For the past 22 years, Hammar has reviewed state and federal court cases involving churches. Using the completed data for 2015, he has pinpointed the top five reasons for church litigation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allegations of child sexual abuse. This issue has been the number one reason for church litigation for 21 of the past 22 years.</li>\n<li>Property claims</li>\n<li>Personal injuries, such as slips and falls or vehicular accidents</li>\n<li> Zoning disputes with the local zoning authority</li>\n<li>Disputes with insurance companies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For Church Mutual, Steinberg says that property claims are their most common, whether from fire, theft, or some form of catastrophic activity. Church Mutual has made use of advances in technology to offer more comprehensive service, including water, temperature, and motion sensors to help protect churches, and drones to inspect damage and provide faster service.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Steinberg says, they have seen a reduction in claims of sexual abuse of minors. Much of that reduction is due to proper background checks and risk management, leading to fewer claims and cases of abuse.</p>\n<p>“I can’t emphasize enough the importance of risk management,” Sparks said, noting that claims are largely reduced or eliminated if a church has the proper risk management practices in place. Risk management enables churches to protect the people under their care.</p>\n<p>“Risk management makes a difference, and that’s the most fitting tribute to our efforts,” Hammar said. “You never know who you’re protecting and whose life you’re saving from tragedy.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/insurance/risk-management/resources/\">Click here</a> to view our Risk Management Resources to learn more about risk management and how you can protect your church from litigation.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the AG Insurance Program, contact AGFinancial Insurance Solutions today at 866.621.1787 or email <a href=\"mailto:info@agfinancialinsurance.com\">info@agfinancialinsurance.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "excerpt": "With changes both in the church and the culture of the nation, the modern pastor looks a little different than the pastor of 25 years ago.",
    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>With changes both in the church and the culture of the nation, the modern pastor looks a little different than the pastor of 25 years ago.</p>\n<p>In <em>The State of Pastors</em>, <a href=\"https://www.barna.com\">Barna Group</a> presents their research from interviews with more than 14,000 senior pastors across multiple denominations. Covering everything from education to family life to spiritual development, this in-depth research offers insights into the life of the average pastor. The research takes the pulse of working in ministry today and helps congregants and church leaders determine ways to better support and encourage the men and women who lead our churches.</p>\n<p>Over the past 25 years, the average age of pastors climbed 10 years, from 44 to 54. In addition, pastors are staying in their churches longer with the average church tenure at 11 years, as compared to just four years in 1992.</p>\n<p>Seventy-two percent of pastors state that they are very satisfied with their vocation, and while 91% claim satisfaction with their quality of life, pastors are more likely than the general population to suffer from feelings of inadequacy about their work, as well as emotional and mental exhaustion. In fact, one in three pastors are at high or medium risk for burnout from stress, whether relational, financial, or as a result of tensions within the church.</p>\n<p>When it comes to finances, the average minister’s salary has risen with average salaries in the U.S. in general—more than 22% since 1992. The median personal income for U.S. adults over 25 with a bachelor’s degree or higher was $71,221 in 2015, and the average annual income for pastors was $63,314.</p>\n<p>Most pastors feel confident about their finances, and many feel that they are in better shape financially compared to U.S. adults overall. A majority of pastors—71%—say that they feel comfortable about their retirement security, and 64% say that they are prepared for unexpected expenditures. Over two-thirds claim they have a trusted advisor from whom they can receive reliable financial advice.</p>\n<p>However, pastors with lower salaries and in churches with smaller ministry budgets are less likely to feel confident about their financial health. Eleven percent of pastors report an annual compensation of $40,000 or less, and these pastors are more apt to say that they are struggling financially. In addition, pastors who express lower satisfaction with their careers or current positions are more likely to see themselves as struggling or merely stable.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the financial health of Assemblies of God ministers in particular, the research in Dr. George O. Wood’s article, <a href=\"http://listassets.ag.org/official/calledtoserve/201701/Called_to_Serve_W17.pdf\"><i>Starting a Conversation about Ministerial Compensation, </i></a>confirms these insights. One-third of AG ministers report some level of stress because of their finances, and 26% would describe their financial situation as unstable. In addition, the average compensation for AG ministers of all types is $38,511, not including honorariums. This number is much lower than the average pastor’s income referenced in <em>The State of Pastors</em>.</p>\n<p>While Barna Group’s research suggests that pastors are generally content with both their relationships and their careers, it also reveals that a dangerous number of ministers are at risk of burnout. Church leaders and congregants have the opportunity to support their pastors through encouragement, both spiritual and emotional, as well as assisting with administrative burdens and reducing financial stress.</p>\n<p>For pastors, their calling and work is a major part of their identity, and it can often be easy to put that work ahead of their personal relationships and emotional and mental health. However, being a good leader requires prioritizing one’s own spiritual and emotional well-being—something that both pastors and church leaders should keep in mind.</p>\n<p>Today’s pastors face numerous challenges, from a shifting culture to changes in how society perceives the church, as well as their own personal challenges that can hinder ministers from reaching others. But, with the support of encouraging church leaders and congregants, a pastor can enjoy a healthier, more productive tenure at their church, fostering the growth of God’s kingdom.</p>\n<p>For more insight into the state of pastors today, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gOUI11D17o\">click here </a>to watch an exclusive interview with Roxanne Stone, Editor in Chief at Barna Group, and AGFinancial’ Andy Whaley, Senior Vice President of Marketing.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p><strong>Are You a Saver or Spender?</strong><br />\nBefore you answer that question, consider this situation: You just received a bonus at work or made $100 from a garage sale. What are your first thoughts? Do you save the money, or treat yourself to something extra?</p>\n<p>Economists have an actual term for this. It’s called the Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS). The MPS is a measure of how much you save when you have additional discretionary income. For example, if your MPS is 0.50, then 50% of every extra dollar you make (discretionary income) is put toward savings. In order to make the most of your discretionary income and savings, your MPS should be as high as possible. This gives each extra dollar a purpose at the end of the month.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s Your Marginal Propensity to Save?</strong><br />\nLet’s say your family has expenses of $3,500 each month and an income of $4,000. You have $500 of discretionary income that you can save. For any additional income above the $4,000 you already make, you have a choice: boost your savings or spend the extra money.</p>\n<p><strong>Making a conscious decision beforehand to save a portion of unexpected raises, bonuses, or money from side jobs can help you manage any extra money with a greater focus.</strong> Whether your goal is to save 50%, 75% or 100% of unexpected income, you can seriously impact your savings goals.</p>\n<p>Knowledge is half the battle.

    "excerpt": "Investing and saving for retirement is an essential step toward a financially secure future, and an Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) is the most common way to start saving.",
    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Investing and saving for retirement is an essential step toward a financially secure future, and an Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) is the most common way to start saving.</p>\n<p>IRAs also offer potential tax benefits for your 2018 federal tax return, up until April 15, 2019. You can defer paying income tax on as much as $5,500 that you contribute to an IRA. Individuals age 50 and older are permitted to contribute an additional $1,000 to an IRA, increasing their tax deductions. IRAs provide one of the only tax deductions available after the end of the year.</p>\n<p>There are several different types of <a href=\"/investments/ira/\">IRA</a>s, but the most common are the traditional IRA and the Roth IRA.</p>\n<p>With a traditional IRA, your earnings and deductible contributions grow tax-deferred. This means that you won’t have to pay income taxes on your earnings and contributions until you begin taking distributions, usually after you retire. You are required to begin taking distributions from a traditional IRA by April 1 following the year in which you turn 70½.</p>\n<p>The requirements for opening a traditional IRA are simple: if you are younger than 70½ and have earned income, you can open and invest in one of these accounts. Withdrawing money, however, is a little more complex.</p>\n<p>You may withdraw money from a traditional IRA at any time, but in most cases there will be a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty if you take money out before age 59½. There are some exceptions to the early withdrawal penalty; generally, you may withdraw from a traditional IRA penalty-free before age 59½ in order to buy your first home, pay for higher education or certain significant medical costs, or because of disability or death. These withdrawals would still be subject to taxes.</p>\n<p>There are no income limits established in order to contribute to a traditional IRA, while a Roth IRA has certain <a href=\"/investments/ira/\">income limits</a> that must be met.</p>\n<p>A Roth IRA enables you to accumulate earnings on a tax-deferred basis and withdraw earnings tax-free for qualified distributions. With this type of account, you are able to withdraw contributions at any time without a penalty, and there is no requirement to start taking distributions at a certain age, like there is with a traditional IRA. However, if you withdraw earnings before age 59½, and before you’ve held the Roth IRA for five years, that money will be subject both to income taxes and a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty.</p>\n<p>Unlike a traditional IRA, contributions to a Roth IRA are not tax-deductible. This rule requires you to pay taxes upfront but allows you to enjoy tax-free withdrawals during retirement.</p>\n<p>In both types of accounts, earnings on investments grow tax-free, and you can convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA later if you wish.</p>\n<p>The traditional IRA and the Roth IRA each have their own benefits and disadvantages, depending on your financial situation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/investments/ira/\">Click here</a> for more information or contact us today at <strong>866.621.1783</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>This information is not legal or tax advice.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <div>\n<p>The start of a new year is an excellent time for churches and ministries to review their budgets, as well as to determine opportunities for ministry growth. One avenue for expansion is the construction of new facilities or updating of current ones, which often requires a church to consider some form of financing.</p>\n<p>Applying for a loan for your church or ministry can be a daunting task. There are many different types of loans and various conditions to consider when going into the process.</p>\n<p>One type of loan is a balloon payment mortgage. A balloon payment mortgage, also known as a balloon loan, does not fully amortize over its term, meaning that, at the end of the term, the borrower is required to repay the remaining balance. This final payment is called a balloon payment because of its large size. Lenders typically refer to these as term loans and even fixed rate loans.</p>\n<p>Balloon loans are typically short-term, usually from three to seven years. The monthly payments in this type of loan are not calculated to cover the entire loan repayment; instead, payments are calculated as if the loan is a standard 30-year mortgage. Therefore, at the end of the five-to-seven-year term, the borrower has repaid only a portion of the principal balance, and the remainder is due all at once.</p>\n<p>Balloon loans are more common in commercial real estate than residential real estate. Generally, loans have balloon payments to offset the lower amount of money that the borrower would put into a loan agreement. Placing a large, fixed sum final payment on the loan allows the lender to lower the interest rate and the monthly repayments while minimizing the lender’s long-term credit risk.</p>\n<p>Some balloon loans have a “reset option,” in which the mortgage resets at the end of the term, utilizing current market rates and a fully amortizing payment schedule. However, this option is not automatic and may only be available under certain conditions. If a balloon loan does not have the reset option, the borrower is expected to pay the remaining loan balance or refinance the loan by the end of the loan term. This situation often causes significant stress and places the ministry in a vulnerable position.</p>\n<p>There are some advantages to balloon loans. These loans often give borrowers access to a low interest rate. But the disadvantages often outweigh the positives, as there is no guarantee that the borrower will be able to refinance at that same lower rate—or will be able to refinance the loan at all. As a result, the borrower may have no choice but to default on the loan.</p>\n<p>Choosing a balloon loan requires the borrower to rely on a lot of if’s—this type of loan is advantageous if property values continue to appreciate, if the borrower’s income and credit capacity do not decrease, and if interest rates remain low. Many financial experts expect interest rates to rise in the near future, creating even more uncertainty related to loan rates. Churches and ministries should think twice before deciding to take on a balloon loan.</p>\n<p>Interested in seeing proven lending options for churches and ministries? <a href=\"/church-loans/types-of-loans-and-process/\">Check out the different types of loans we offer.</a></p>\n<p>If you are looking for a lender who shares your core Christian values and want to start the conversation, contact us today at 800.449.5626 or <a href=\"mailto:churchloans@agfinancial.org\">churchloans@agfinancial.org</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>The start of a new year is a common time to make resolutions for personal growth and change, whether that’s getting healthy, expanding your education, or improving your finances. But only about eight percent of people who make New Year’s resolutions actually <a href=\"http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/\">keep them</a>. You won’t accomplish your goals without a solid plan for reaching them.</p>\n<p>Here are seven steps you can take to help achieve your financial goals in the new year.</p>\n<p><strong>1) Define your goals.</strong> When setting financial goals, make sure that they are clearly defined and measurable. “Saving money” is not a clear goal; instead, determine a specific amount of money you would like to save. Set deadlines to help you monitor your progress, and take advantage of available tools for establishing and tracking your goals. There are plenty of books, websites, computer programs, and cell phone apps that can help keep you on track to achieve your financial goals.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Make realistic goals</strong>. Be sure to set goals that are attainable. Setting goals that are out of your reach can quickly become disheartening. Start with small, simple goals that are more easily reachable, such as saving just a small percentage of your income each pay period. If you find that goal easy to attain, raise the percentage. Start small and work your way up to bigger goals.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Prioritize your goals.</strong> Determine which goals are the most important to you. Maybe you want to take an international vacation, but you also want to save for a new car. Your current financial situation may not allow you to reach for both goals at once, so you must decide which goal takes priority. Keep in mind that long-term goals are more beneficial than short-term goals, so plans like saving for retirement should take precedence over more minor objectives.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Review your expenses.</strong> The best way to figure out how much you can save is to look at how much you spend. List out your monthly expenses, separating them into two categories: fixed spending, such as bills, and discretionary spending, such as unessential purchases. Once you’ve separated your expenses, review each item to determine how you can reduce that expenditure. The more money you can free up each month, the more you can save toward your goals.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Assess your financial habits.</strong> Are you quick to spend money on things you don’t need? Do you have a tendency to pay bills late? Creating good financial habits is essential to achieving your financial goals. Determine your bad habits and draft a plan for changing them. Set up automatic savings to make sure you’re always setting money aside. Use cash to limit your spending. If you have trouble paying your bills on time, set up autopay to make sure you never miss a payment.</p>\n<p><strong>6) Prepare for the unexpected.</strong> Most financial experts recommend setting up an emergency fund to cover any unanticipated bills. You should try to have about three to six months of your salary saved up in case of an unexpected job loss or expense. Keep your emergency funds in a separate account to eliminate the temptation to spend it.</p>\n<p><strong>7) Monitor your goals and progress</strong>. Review your financial goals and progress regularly. You may need to adjust your goals or set new ones. Reviewing your goals gives you an opportunity to reflect on what you want out of life and to make sure that you’re taking the necessary steps to get there. Don’t be afraid to reassess—your goals are not set in stone.</p>\n<p>Reaching your financial goals can be daunting but not impossible. With a little organization, focus, and determination, you can achieve your financial goals and keep your financial new year’s resolutions.</p>\n<p><strong>Related article: <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid107180preparing-for-retirement-a-checklist/\">Preparing for Retirement: A Checklist</a><br /></strong></p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>With the holidays quickly approaching, we’re reminded of many opportunities to give to others. The season is a time of giving and generosity, and charitable donations can have a beneficial effect on taxpayer’s annual federal taxes. For many, this time of year is a reminder to be grateful and to share the wealth we have with others.</p>\n<p>Many charitable organizations receive almost half of their annual donations between the months of October and December. A year-end gift can help a ministry continue its mission and may entitle the donor to a tax deduction.</p>\n<p>Through charitable giving, a person can reduce the amount of earned income that is subject to tax. These gifts are deductible in the year in which they are made, meaning a donor has until December 31 to send a gift to a qualified charitable organization.</p>\n<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when making year-end gifts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remember to get a receipt. The IRS requires written documentation to substantiate deductions for any monetary donations.</li>\n<li>Make sure to verify that the organization has <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/search-for-charities\">federal tax-exempt status</a> before donating. Otherwise, the gift will not be deductible. </li>\n<li>Know the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-select-check-deductibility-status-codes\">deduction limits for 2016</a>. You can give as much as you want, but the IRS limits the amount of deductions.</li>\n<li>Keep in mind that any non-cash contributions such as clothing, household items, or electronics greater than $250 require documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While cash is the most common way to donate, there are other methods taxpayers can use to contribute to charities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Give appreciated securities, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. When these securities are donated, the taxpayer can avoid capital gains taxes.</li>\n<li>Establish a Donor Advised Fund (DAF). If a person creates a DAF, they may deduct the value of that charitable gift on current year’s taxes but then advise distribution of the funds to charitable organizations in a later tax year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to tax benefits, donating to a charity sets an example for children about the importance of giving to those in need. Choosing a charity together can be a bonding experience for a family as parents demonstrate the value of compassion to their children. Children whose parents talk to them about charitable giving are more likely to give to charity than children whose parents do not discuss giving with them; <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/teach-your-kids-about-generosity-not-just-money/?mobile=true\">click here</a> to learn more.

And when changes occur, your current beneficiary choices — who will inherit your life insurance, pension, IRAs, etc. — may need to be updated.</p>\n<p>Take time now to review your beneficiaries. You should select both primary and contingent beneficiaries. Contingent beneficiaries will inherit if the primary beneficiaries precede you in death. If you name your spouse as beneficiary, you can avoid income and estate taxes. Additionally, your spouse can roll over your retirement account to his or her own IRA.</p>\n<p>Without living beneficiaries, your assets may be transferred to your estate and state law determines who receives it. The presumption is that the heirs named in your will should receive the proceeds, but this could be challenged as beneficiary designations may supersede your will.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Fall is almost here, and the change of the season brings cooler temperatures, turning leaves, and church Fall Festivals. If your church is hosting a trick-or-treat event for kids – or something similar – here are a few tips that can help your Fall Festival become a fun and safe annual event.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Pre-Packaged Candy</strong><br />Make sure all candy given to children is pre-packed and in its original packaging. Remind parents to toss out any candy that looks like it’s been tampered with.</p>\n<p><strong>Have Traffic Control</strong><br />Many times Fall Festivals will last until it’s dark outside. Make sure your parking lot has proper lighting and traffic control to protect kids going to and from cars.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid Tripping Hazards</strong><br />A top reason for insurance claims during fall harvest parties comes from slips and falls. Make sure walking paths are clear of tripping hazards. If your church is having a costume event, post costume guidelines for parents to follow in advance of the event. Parents should make sure their child’s mask allows full visibility and avoid costumes that are overly loose or have fabric dragging to the floor.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Flameless Candles</strong><br />Having open flames at a Harvest party is an unnecessary threat. We recommend swapping traditional candles for nonflammable LED candles to avoid fire hazards.</p>\n<p><strong>Review Third-Party Vendor Contracts</strong><br />As you use third-party vendors, make sure vendors sign a contract with your church, and always require a certificate of insurance (preferably naming the church as an additional insured). This is especially important for vendors for inflatables/bounce houses.</p>\n<p>When reviewing the contract, look for a section that says you will hold the company harmless and indemnify them from anything that happens. “It’s imperative to remove this section from the contract,” says Jerry Sparks, President of AGFinancial Insurance. “Many vendors will remove this section for a small up charge. Failure to remove this section could result in the church being liable to the vendor even if the vendor is negligent.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Hosting a Hayride?</strong><br />If your church is hosting a hayride, there are a variety of safety tips you should implement to maximize safety. We have a video on this topic that will help you keep your church members safe on your next hayride. </p>\n<div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5N_3mL-Y06w\" width=\"641\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>While this list is not exhaustive, it does provide a good starting point in helping to create a safe Fall Festival.

Reasons you need an emergency fund go beyond an unexpected job loss or medical expense. An emergency fund is protection against building up debt and weakening your financial security.</p>\n<p>According to the Federal Reserve’s Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households report, 40% of people don’t have enough money to cover an unexpected $400 expense.*</p>\n<p>If you are like the 40% without a “rainy day” fund, your first goal, after eliminating credit card debt, should be to build up your cash reserves to cover three to six months of living expenses.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>If you or your church has a short-term mission trip planned in the near future, there’s a good chance that you’ve looked into travel insurance.</p>\n<p>Some people research foreign liability and contingent auto coverage but balk at moving forward with a policy because minimum premiums can be up to $2,500. Others make the mistake of thinking they don’t need travel insurance because they already have health insurance. Depending on your coverage, though, it’s very unlikely to provide the proper coverage when traveling abroad. Some companies provide inadequate limits of coverage like $5,000, and that coverage may not even include sickness. </p>\n<p>Recently there was a mission group building churches in Latin America. A team member collapsed and incurred medical costs of over $10,000. Another person on the trip was struck by a motorcycle while crossing the street. This person’s medical costs were around $20,000. It’s also worth noting that medical facilities may not be readily available in remote areas, and an ambulance or helicopter transport will lead to even greater expenses.</p>\n<p>And what happens if someone dies on a mission trip? A volunteer with past health issues recently passed away on a mission trip to Israel. Most people don’t think about how much it can cost to repatriate a body back to the United States—it can exceed $50,000. It is helpful to have a knowledgeable person assisting in making those plans.</p>\n<p>Like all types of insurance, travel insurance is something you hope you never use, but it can provide a much-needed safety net if the unfortunate does occur. This important need, for those traveling on short-term mission trips, is what led AGFinancial Insurance Solutions to create a unique travel insurance product called <em><a href=\"http://agfinancial.org/mission-assure\">Mission Assure</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Unlike other programs that require large minimum premiums, the <em><a href=\"http://agfinancial.org/mission-assure\">Mission Assure</a></em> policy has a low daily premium to provide you with an affordable alternative with second-to-none coverage. It costs just $2.50/day for domestic travelers and $4.50/day for foreign travelers to receive full coverage.</p>\n<p>Think of it like this: Imagine your church is planning a 10-day mission trip to India. A plane ticket for one person can cost around $1,200. Full coverage for each individual during the trip, though, is just $45. </p>\n<p>And with <a href=\"http://agfinancial.org/mission-assure\"><em>Mission Assure</em></a>, there are no limits on age and you can’t be excluded from coverage due to pre-existing conditions.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing you, your group – and your church – are financially protected on your next short-term mission trip.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about <a href=\"http://agfinancial.org/mission-assure\"><em>Mission Assure</em></a>, you can learn more at <a href=\"http://agfinancial.org/mission-assure\">agfinancial.org/mission-assure</a>.</p>\n<p>You can also contact us at 866.890.0156 or <a href=\"mailto:missionassure@agfinancial.org\">missionassure@agfinancial.org</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<p>Information is from sources deemed reliable. Information is subject to error, omission, withdrawal, or change.</p>\n<p>A quote of benefits does not guarantee payment or verify eligibility. Payment of benefits are subject to all terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insured’s contract at time of event.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Many Americans end up with two or three retirement accounts due to changing employers or opening IRAs. A rollover is an ideal tool for simplifying retirement savings.</p>\n<p><strong>What is a Rollover? </strong><br />\nA rollover is simply the movement of money from a retirement plan such as an IRA or 401(k) into another qualified retirement plan. You are eligible for a rollover if you meet a qualifying event such as a change of employment, disability, or reaching age 59½. If you meet one of these qualifiers, you may roll your retirement accounts into a single manageable account. A rollover also allows you to continue the tax-deferred status of your retirement accounts, enabling you to avoid early withdrawal penalties.</p>\n<p><strong>A Rollover is Simple, Easy, and Tax-Free. </strong><br />\nManaging multiple retirement accounts can be complicated. The hassle of tracking old 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and multiple IRAs can be time-consuming and costly, especially if you’re not paying attention to the fees the financial company may be charging. A great way to overcome the stress of multiple retirement accounts is to roll your funds into a single retirement account.</p>\n<p>The top 3 reasons to roll over your retirement accounts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A qualified rollover is a tax-free event</strong>.<br />\nYou can move your funds into a single account such as your MBA 403(b) and maintain the tax-deferred status of your retirement account.</li>\n<li><strong>Sound investment options</strong>.<br />\nThe MBA 403(b) offers a variety of choices allowing diversification and customization of your retirement plan with options such as the fixed rate MBA Income Fund as well as the screened Steward Mutual Funds and Russell LifePoints<sup>®</sup> Funds. Click here for rollover options if you are not an AG minister or ministry employee.</li>\n<li><strong>Simplicity and ease.</strong><br />\nInstead of dealing with multiple statements every month, you can track your balance, investment options, and performance with one quick glance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about rollovers, contact us at 1.877.700.5177 or email <a href=\"mailto:rollover@agfinancial.org\">rollover@agfinancial.org</a>.</p>\n<h5><a href=\"/retirement-planning/403b/\">Simplify Your Retirement Today with a Rollover </a></h5>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Life insurance is a crucial protection for families, especially those with young children, but often it doesn’t get the attention it deserves. Just as you occasionally reevaluate your car or homeowner’s insurance, it’s worth taking time to also look at your life insurance policy to see if it still meets your needs. And if you don’t have a life insurance policy, now may be a good time to obtain coverage.</p>\n<p><strong><br />\n</strong>Start by asking yourself the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Am I the primary or only wage earner in my household?</li>\n<li>Am I the lead pastor and/or main revenue creator for my ministry?</li>\n<li>Have I recently had a life event happen (marriage, new baby, bought a house, taken on debt, etc.)?</li>\n<li>Did I recently start a business using personal assets as collateral?</li>\n<li>Did I purchase my current policy before January 1, 2009?*</li>\n<li>Do I have a need for long-term care insurance?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you answered yes to <em>any</em> of these, you have good reason to consider increasing your coverage or obtaining <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/insurance/life/\">life insurance</a> if you don’t have it. You should have enough coverage to give your family peace of mind about their financial future if you were to pass away prematurely. <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/insurance/request-a-quote/individual-life/\">Requesting a quote </a>is simple and free.</p>\n<p><strong>How Much Coverage do I Need? </strong></p>\n<p>Most people underestimate their coverage needs. It is recommended to obtain, at the minimum, the equivalent of five to ten times your annual salary plus enough to cover 70% or more of any debt you may have.</p>\n<p>Having 10 times your annual salary in coverage helps ensure your loved ones will have adequate provision to maintain their current lifestyle and avoid the stress of financial hardships. Additionally, if you have children, the funds may be invested for their future educational or other needs that your income would have provided. In addition, your loved ones will not have to pay federal income tax on the life insurance benefit they receive.**</p>\n<p><strong>What if I can’t afford the coverage I need?</strong></p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.limra.com/en/newsroom/news-releases/2017/2017-insurance-barometer-study-reveals-that-consumers-want-transparent-life-insurance-buying-options/\"><em>2017 Insurance Barometer Study</em></a> research report by LL Global/LIMRA and Life Happens, consumers often overestimate life insurance costs which can keep people from buying life insurance at all. This also means people who do decide to buy life insurance often fail to obtain the amount of coverage they truly need because they mistakenly believe it will cost too much.</p>\n<p>For example, the median estimate for a $250,000 term life insurance policy for a healthy 30-year-old was $500, which is three times what it would actually cost.</p>\n<p><strong>Life Insurance with Long-term Care Riders: One Product, Two Solutions.</strong></p>\n<p>Long-term care (LTC) is becoming more important as the Baby Boomer generation approaches retirement and beyond. Traditional LTC policies have increasing premiums, which are less than ideal. They can often be a budget buster for those in retirement. Additionally, not all of these policies offer a death benefit, so many times the policy holders may feel like they never receive any benefit for the premium dollars they are spending each year.</p>\n<p>To meet these needs, insurance companies have created LTC riders that can be added to both term &amp; permanent life insurance policies. For a modest increase in premium (often less than 10%) you can turn your life insurance death benefit into a pool of LTC benefits. Even better, if you never need the LTC benefits, you have peace of mind knowing that your family will receive the life insurance death benefit when you pass away.</p>\n<p>AGFinancial Insurance Solutions provides life insurance customized to fit your personal and ministry needs. If you would like more information, call 866.621.1787 or <a href=\"mailto:info@agfinancial.org\">email us</a>.</p>\n<p><em>*This is the legal date at which insurance </em><em>companies must use the new 2001 Mortality Table. As life expectancy increases, insurance premiums decrease. You may find a new policy costs less than your current one, even if you are older.</em></p>\n<p><em>**Based on current tax laws, life insurance bought with after-tax dollars is transferred to beneficiaries tax-free. To avoid a taxable event for your church, never mix <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid106871losing-a-leader-how-key-man-insurance-can-help-your-church-recover/\">personal and key man insurance policies</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>For kids, summer camp means spending time with friends, swimming, campfires, and outdoor activities. For churches and districts however, it means a higher level of risk. The two most common risks associated with camps are personal injuries and sexual abuse. Fortunately, there are things you can do to mitigate these risks and plan for a safe summer.</p>\n<p><strong>INJURY PREVENTION<br /></strong>Although injuries can happen during many camp activities, the most severe are often associated with inflatables, golf carts, and swimming activities. It’s important to limit the use of golf carts to adults only. As for inflatables, be sure to carefully follow manufacturers’ instructions, especially with floating lake blobs. And make sure you evaluate each child’s swimming* ability. We recommend using color-coded bands (Church Mutual offers <a href=\"https://www.churchmutual.com/107/Swimmer-Safety-Program-is-valuable,-life-saving-tool\">these color-coded bands</a> free of charge for their customers):</p>\n<p><span><strong>Red</strong></span>: Non-swimmers<br /><span><strong>Yellow</strong></span>: Shallow water only<br /><span><strong>Green</strong></span>: Qualified swimmers</p>\n<p><em>*Swimming should be supervised at all times by a CPR-certified lifeguard.</em></p>\n<p>You’ll also want to make sure you have a consent form on file documenting parental permission for the activities the child is allowed to participate in. This form should include emergency contact information and a release to provide medical care if a camper gets injured while proper precautions are followed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://info.agfinancial.org/l/147031/2016-05-10/56trh/147031/8432/Camp_Registration_2016__With_Health_History_.pdf\">Download Camp Registration Form</a> </p>\n<p><strong>SEXUAL ABUSE PREVENTION<br /></strong>Screen every adult who will be involved in any capacity with minors. Proper screening procedures include a criminal records check, a national sex offender registry check, and the contacting and documentation of two references. In addition to this, we recommend having a six-month church membership policy for workers as well as maintaining a two-adult rule during camp. That means no one minor is ever alone with only one adult. As a best practice, benchmark all procedures with the public schools in your area, as they will be required to meet or exceed state standards of reasonable care.</p>\n<p>To learn additional best practices for these risk areas, watch this <a href=\"/insurance/risk-management/riskmgmtlive/\">risk<em>mgmt</em>LIVE</a>:</p>\n<div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KaQh1uDcWUI?list=PLS35Et-nHKCyBb23R2pHbuDu-YmGETdQT\" width=\"641\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>We hope your church enjoys a safe and exciting summer filled with ministry opportunities.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>AGFinancial (AGFS) wants to help make saving for retirement easier on you. Collecting and managing multiple retirement accounts probably isn’t your idea of a hobby. For many, it can be time consuming or flat out confusing. Avoid that by considering a rollover.</p>\n<p>What are the <a href=\"/retirement-planning/403b/\">benefits of a rollover</a>? It consolidates your retirement into a single, manageable account. Instead of dealing with multiple statements and accounts, you can track your balance, investment options, and performance with one quick glance. If you've changed jobs, suffered a disability, or have reached age 59½, you are eligible for a rollover.</p>\n<p>Even more, a qualified rollover is a tax-free event. You can roll over your other retirement funds into a single retirement account with us and maintain the tax-deferred status of your investments. Cashing out your retirement when you change employers can be tempting, but in most cases you should avoid doing so. Your distribution may be fully taxable and you could have a 10% penalty assessed if you are under age 59½.</p>\n<p>A rollover also allows you to reassess your investment strategy. If you’ve let other retirement accounts sit without giving them any attention, you’ll probably need to reevaluate how they’re invested. Your risk tolerance may not be the same as it was when you started at your job. That means your existing account may be more aggressive in the market than you want. Take the time to review your portfolio when you do a rollover so you can be on a better track with your investments.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:retirement@agfinancial.org\">Have questions? Contact our rollover specialist.</a></p>\n<p>If you're interested in <a href=\"/retirement-planning/403b/\">rolling over your retirement to AGFS</a>, consider our <a href=\"/retirement-planning/403b/fund-descriptors/\">MBA Income Fund</a>. It is a fixed rate investment option that's had an attractive rate of return since its inception nearly 60 years ago, and its funds are used to build AG churches and ministries.</p>\n<p>In addition to the MBA Income Fund, we also offer a variety of low-cost, faith-based investment options to those seeking potentially higher returns for additional risks. The Steward Funds provides a screened indexed approach, avoiding investments in companies that derive a significant portion of their revenue from abortion, pornography, alcohol, tobacco, and gambling. Included in this family of funds is the award-winning Steward Global Equity Income Fund Institutional Class, the recipient of the 2015 Thomson Reuters Lipper Fund Award, an award recognizing funds that deliver consistently strong risk-adjusted performance relative to its peers.</p>\n<p>Take action today.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>There are many studies that touch on the effects that handling money has on children. Most of these studies highlight the importance of learning the value of a dollar and recognizing that money is earned, not given. </p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://discover.umn.edu/news/business-law/money-affects-childrens-behavior-even-if-value-not-understood\">recent study</a> published by University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management and University of Illinois at Chicago supports claims that children who are exposed to money at a young age tend to work harder and have a better understanding of the value of a dollar. However, the study introduced a potential negative effect money can have on children: it might make them less generous.</p>\n<p>The study consisted of multiple experiments that separated children into three groups: money sorters, button sorters, and sticker sorters. The children who sorted money were less likely to help an adult clean up the room after the experiment. They were also less generous with the rewards they received during the experiments. </p>\n<p>Kathleen Vohs, the Land O’Lakes Chair in Marketing at the University of Minnesota and co-author of the study, said that the behavior in children mirrors patterns in adults studied in Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>\n<p>So what does this mean? The study confirmed some positive results about the effects money can have on children. For instance, the children who sorted money instead of buttons or stickers showed a willingness to work longer on difficult tasks while children in the other groups tended to give up sooner.</p>\n<p>It’s important to continue to <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/teaching-your-kids-about-money-part-1/\">educate your child about money.</a> However, that’s not enough. Parents must teach kids about generosity, not just money. Jesus said it’s better to give than it is to receive (Acts 20:35), but how can parents instill that idea in their children?</p>\n<p>Simply by talking to them.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.unfoundation.org/assets/pdf/kids-give-report.pdf\">a 2013 study</a> conducted by the Women’s Philanthropy Institute at Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, “talking about charitable giving is more effective than simply role-modeling charitable behavior.”</p>\n<p>The Indiana University study indicated that 87 percent of the children said their parents talked to them about giving to charity. Also, 88 percent of the children in the study either gave money to or volunteered for a charitable cause at least once during a two-year period.</p>\n<p>Teaching your kids about money is certainly an important element of parenting that should not be abandoned. Equally important, though, is teaching your children about charitable giving and selflessness. After all, what parent wouldn’t like seeing their child embrace Biblical principles of generosity?</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

According to <strong><a href=\"http://pittsburgh.about.com/od/holidays/tp/resolutions.htm\" rel=\"noopener\">About.com</a></strong>, “getting out of debt” and “getting organized” are the seventh and tenth most popular resolutions, respectively.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>This article addresses valuable financial tips that will benefit most budgets, whether you’re in debt or not. In doing so, you’ll be able to get better control of your finances by implementing organization into your budget. Consider it a two-for-one.</p>\n<h2>Assess and Refine Your Budget</h2>\n<p>This may not seem like new advice, but even if you already have a working budget, it’s worthwhile to look at it with fresh eyes as the year begins. Ask yourself the following questions:</p>\n<p><strong>Does my budget support my financial goals?<br />\n</strong>Take time to write down your financial goals and then build monthly allocations into your budget. While vacations and significant purchases may be on your list, make sure you also establish goals for retirement.</p>\n<p><strong>Are my tax needs factored into my budget?<br />\n</strong>Nobody likes getting a tax bill at the end of the year, but a large refund isn’t necessarily a better alternative. It may feel nice to get a sudden influx of money, but that is money you could be earning interest on as you set it aside to reach your goals faster. Try to find a balance between the two and minimize your refund.</p>\n<p><strong>Is my budget written down?<br />\n</strong>You can do this with apps, spreadsheets, or pen and paper. It doesn’t have to be sophisticated. Just make sure to designate a category for every dollar earned and spent. Don't forget to include expenses such as car tags, oil changes, property taxes, and even Christmas gifts. Make sure no expense is overlooked.</p>\n<p><strong>Do I live by my budget?<br />\n</strong>A budget should be firm enough to keep you on track toward your goals but flexible enough to allow for unexpected expenses. If you get off track, it’s important to get back to the budget right away. Getting off track is a learning opportunity. Use it to assess your budget and see where you might be able to cut back in order to save money for any future, unforeseen events.</p>\n<h2>Save Smart</h2>\n<p>This year, don’t just save more, save smart. The point of saving money is to reach financial goals faster. One very easy way to save smart is to put your money where you'll earn a higher interest rate than what you'll typically find with a standard savings account at a bank or credit union. These include money market accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs), which may offer rates several percentage points above a regular savings account.</p>\n<p>Contrary to what many think, you don’t have to have a lot of money to start. For example,<a href=\"/investments/types-of-investments/\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong> AGFinancial Investment Certificates</strong></a>, begin with a minimum investment of $250.</p>\n<p>You can take your investments a step further by setting up a laddering strategy. This approach staggers your investments so they mature at different times. Doing so enables you to take advantage of higher interest rates while maintaining regular accessibility to your funds. This strategy also lets you achieve more consistent earnings in spite of fluctuating interest rates.</p>\n<div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h6dQaZq8X5k\" width=\"639\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<h2>Plan for Retirement</h2>\n<p><strong>Open a Retirement Account.<br />\n</strong>If you have access to an employer account, such as a 401(k) or 403(b), set one up. Alternatively, you can contribute to an Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA). There are several different types including Traditional, Roth, and Simplified Employee Pension (SEP), which is a great option for the self-employed.</p>\n<p><strong>Make regular contributions<br />\n</strong>Get an idea of how much you’ll need to save with these easy <strong><a href=\"/retirement-planning/calculators/\">retirement calculators</a></strong>. Make budget allocations accordingly. The most painless way to save for retirement is to have contributions automatically deducted from your income. You may be pleasantly surprised and find that you don't even miss that money.</p>\n<p><strong>Increase your contributions over time.<br />\n</strong>It’s absolutely okay to start small, but make it your goal to increase the amount little by little. If your employer offers matching contributions, try to build up your amount until you’re taking full advantage of this benefit.</p>\n<p>These resolutions will help you build a stable financial future.

These types of accounts fell out of popularity in the 1970’s and are rarely offered at financial institutions anymore. During their heyday, though, Christmas clubs served a very practical purpose: help people budget for Christmas spending.<!--more--></p>\n<p>Merkel Landis, treasurer of the Carlisle Trust Company, created the first known Christmas savings fund in 1909. There were about 350 account holders with an average of $28 (which equates to roughly $330 in today’s market).</p>\n<p>These accounts weren’t meant to collect a great deal of interest or compound the account holders’ money. They were essentially started so people could protect their money from themselves, most notably by charging fees for withdrawals before the holiday season.</p>\n<p>(Article continued below image)</p>\n<p><img title=\"ag-financial-christmas-club-ad\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/25853/ag_financial_christmas_club_article_amskeag_savings_bank.jpg?t=1450892649425\" alt=\"ag-financial_christmas_club\" width=\"100%\" /></p>\n<p><em>An old brochure promoting Santa's Dime Saver Christmas Club at Amoskeag Savings Bank.

Low interest rates and an assortment of fees meant fewer customers were willing to open Christmas club accounts, and the additional costs of managing extra accounts combined to slowly phase out Christmas clubs.</p>\n<p>Even though they were started over 100 years ago, though, one thing has remained the same: many people still have a difficult time saving money. If you haven’t done so in the past, we recommend starting a Christmas budget early in the year. Between travel, food, and gifts, Christmas expenses can add up quickly. Setting aside a few dollars a week throughout the year can make the season of giving more affordable and less stressful.</p>\n<p>Most financial institutions have deposited Christmas clubs into their history books, but the idea behind them is alive and well: saving for Christmas is an important part of most household budgets.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

Unlike an RMD, the charitable distribution is not included in your adjusted gross income. This reduction of your adjusted gross income is significant as it may place you in a lower tax bracket, reduce or eliminate your Social Security taxation, reduce Medicare surtax and premium costs, and allow eligibility for other deductions and credits that may not have been available had you been forced to include the RMD as income.</p>\n<p>There are eligibility rules that include age limits (you must be 70½), charitable contributions are limited to $108,000 per person for 2025, and distributions must be made directly from the IRA custodian to the qualified charity. Additionally, the charity must be a 501(c)(3) organization. Of course, you can make charitable contributions greater than $100,000 or outside of a QCD, but those contributions will not reduce your adjusted gross income.</p>\n<p>Note that a QCD can be executed at any time but December 31 is the deadline in the year for which you want to fund the contribution using your RMD.</p>\n<p>Learn about the<a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/resources/article/opportunity\"><strong> SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022</strong></a> that allows you to make a one-time distribution from your IRA—up to $54,000 (in 2025)* of your annual Qualified Charitable Distribution limit (QCD)—into a<a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/services/individual-services/individual-planned-giving/charitable-gift-annuities\"> Charitable Gift Annuity.</a>**</p>\n<p>For more information, <a href=\"mailto: abc@example.com\">contact us</a> today.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Just saying the words “one million” invokes thoughts of a massive amount. In terms of people, there are just 10 cities in the U.S. that have that many residents. In terms of days, there have been less than 740,000 days since the calendar shifted from “B.C.” to “A.D.”—not even three-quarters of one million.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>In terms of money, though, there is a certain amount of prestige with the number one million that other numbers don’t possess. But has “one million” become more of a necessity than a status symbol?</p>\n<p>Google “How much money do I need to retire” and you’ll find more numbers and calculations than a high school math book, but there’s one figure that shows up time and time again: one million.</p>\n<p>Many consider “one million” to be the magic number of retirement. Have it and you’re in good shape; fall short and you’re in for a tough time. But is that true? Do you really need one million dollars?</p>\n<p>The answer is an old favorite: it depends.</p>\n<p>Some financial experts say you’ll need 11-12 times your annual pay stashed away for your retirement. Some even suggest having up to 18 times your annual pay. If you’re looking for a specific number on how much money you’ll need, somewhere between $825,000-$1.3 million is typically advised (based on a household earning $75,000/year).</p>\n<p>But that’s a pretty large gap, and when it comes to retirement, it’s better to be safe than sorry. Here are some things to consider:</p>\n<p><strong>Life Expectancy<br />\n</strong>According to the Society of Actuaries, for a married 65-year-old couple, there is a 45% chance of one person reaching 90 and a 20% chance one will reach 95. Your retirement may need to sustain you for a few <em>decades</em>, not a few years.</p>\n<p><strong>Inflation<br />\n</strong>Think about this. It would take approximately $12,000 today to have the spending power $5,000 had in 1982. Having “just enough” for retirement today could mean struggling years down the road. Plan on your spending power being cut in half every 25-30 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Medical Costs<br />\n</strong>Health costs will rise as you get older. Even with healthcare benefits, a 65-year-old couple could end up spending $270,000 on out-of-pocket medical expenses. Without benefits, out-of-pocket costs could climb to $450,000. It is important to take these expenses into consideration when planning your retirement.</p>\n<p><strong>Unexpected Costs<br />\n</strong>Inflation can rise. Your basement might get flooded. Your car may break down. There are a lot of things in life we can’t control, and they can add up quickly. It’s imperative to have money set aside for such contingencies.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong>So what do you do now? Look at your monthly expenses and find a few areas where you can cut back (or cut out completely). This is a <em>very </em>crucial step if you’re nearing retirement.</p>\n<p>And when planning for your retirement, split up fixed costs and discretionary costs. Make sure all fixed costs are covered before moving on to discretionary expenditures.</p>\n<p>Every budget is as unique as the individual maintaining it. There’s no one-size-fits-all retirement plan, but with careful planning and a little self-restraint, you can experience a financially stable retirement.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Sources:<br />\n</strong><a href=\"https://business.time.com/2013/02/11/sizing-up-the-big-question-how-much-money-do-you-need-to-retire/\" rel=\"noopener\">Time Business<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/on-retirement/2014/08/19/how-much-money-do-you-need-to-retire\" rel=\"noopener\">US News</a></p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

People camp out for hours at their favorite store before pushing, shoving, and tackling until they score big savings. </span></p>\n<p><span>Perhaps that sort of atmosphere is what has caused in-store spending to go down each year since 2012 and online spending to go up every year since 2010. And even though in-store sales were down almost 9% in 2014, consumers still spent more than $50 million in brick-and-mortar shops.</span></p>\n<p><span>Since 2010, consumers have spent nearly $400 per person on Black Friday deals. If you’re one of the many who takes part in Black Friday shopping, it can be a great time to save money on Christmas gifts and items you need for your home. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, saving money in a sale also requires spending money, so make sure you stick to a budget. The $400 you saved on a new television may feel great when you make the purchase, but when you see an extra $600 on your credit card bill, that joy may quickly disappear.</span></p>\n<p><span>The chaos and hype surrounding Black Friday shopping can make keeping a level head difficult, but this day shouldn’t be different than any other time you spend money.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>When taking out a church loan, pastors are making a large financial commitment to their church’s future. It’s a process that should include smart planning and prayerful consideration.</p>\n<p>Taking out a loan before your church is ready can have negative effects for everyone involved. We want to share a few mistakes that we’ve seen that you should take into consideration when thinking about a loan for your church.<!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>1. Don’t Purchase Before You’re Ready</strong><br /> If your church is currently renting its facility, you may feel the desire to build your own facility. Remember, though, there are more costs involved with owning than just buying the land and building a structure. There’s maintenance, lawn care, extra insurance, and a myriad of other costs.</p>\n<p>And don’t take the flexibility of renting for granted. Many landlords are willing to negotiate with good tenants. But when it comes to a mortgage, lenders are typically less forgiving.</p>\n<p>Buying land and starting construction is an important and exciting time in every church. Just make sure your God-given vision for buying aligns with His timing.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Evaluate the Budget Regularly</strong> <br /> As you review your budget, be sure to assess where you should be spending your money. If you’re not the type of person who can commit to creating, following, and evaluating a budget you need to surround yourself with someone who can. A good leader knows his weaknesses and is willing to delegate those tasks to people who can help. Your church’s budget is too important to overlook or avoid.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Hire Appropriately</strong> <br /> If you’re starting a new church, it may not be necessary or financially feasible to hire somebody for every unique job. Determine if there are tasks that can be added to traditional roles in the church, or create your own roles. When your church is in its infancy, finding people who are willing and able to perform multiple duties is a huge benefit.</p>\n<p><span>Make sure the people you hire believe in your church’s vision and will commit themselves to it.</span></p>\n<p>Another common mistake churches make when it comes to hiring is not hiring people who are in it for the long haul. Make sure the people you hire believe in your church’s vision and will commit themselves to it. Hiring a talented, passionate person who’s only going to be there for a year because he wants to start his own ministry may sound like a good idea, but when you’re investing a significant amount of time and resources into vetting and hiring new employees, this may not be a financially wise decision. </p>\n<p>Of course there are many other things to consider before taking out a church loan, but by avoiding these three mistakes you’ll be more prepared to determine if your church is ready to take that final step.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>AGFinancial is one of the nation’s largest church lenders.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>In a recent <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/teaching-your-kids-about-money-part-1/\">article</a> we talked about the importance of teaching your children the value of delayed gratification in regards to money. Introducing a sound financial principle to your children is crucial, but it should be the first step of many, not a one-time scenario.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Talking about finances to your kids makes them more likely to be knowledgeable about taxes, credit, managing money, and other basic financial principles. And best of all, this is a topic most kids want to talk about. In fact, according to a study by JuiorAchievement.org, 84% of teens want their parents to talk to them about money. Unfortunately, 74% of parents say they are reluctant to do so.</p>\n<p>Many parents miss out on the opportunity to build a solid financial foundation with their children—especially if the child is a girl. Girls who participated in the study were less likely to have parents who talked to them about saving money and managing finances. Only 24% of girls said their parents talked to them about managing money compared to 40% of boys. Having good financial principles is not a gender-specific quality. Talk to your daughter about money the same way you’d talk to your son. Women need financial wisdom as much as men.</p>\n<p>And when you talk to your kids about finances, be honest with them. According to Forbes, 28% of parents say they’ve lied to their kids about being able to afford something. When your child asks you for something and you don’t want to buy it, don’t make “we can’t afford it” your default answer. Explain to kids why it may not be a good idea to make that purchase. Doing this will teach your children the process in making sound financial decisions that will help them as they get older. </p>\n<p>Lastly, remember to practice what you preach. According to the survey, 89% of parents believe their children learn their financial behaviors from them, so make sure your own financial habits reinforce what you teach your children.</p>\n<p>Talking to your kids about finances is a big step, so how do you get started? Incorporate your children into everyday activities. Take them grocery shopping with you. Discuss your budget. Tell them why you buy some items and why you don’t buy others. You can also help them open a savings account or even do something as simple as playing a game of <em>Monopoly</em>.</p>\n<p>Talking with your kids about money can open up financial conversations that make you more likely to contribute to savings, follow a budget and save for retirement*, so don’t let hesitation stop you from engaging your children.</p>\n<p>Having family discussions about money is a game everybody wins—and unlike <em>Monopoly</em>, everyone involved still gets along after it’s over.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AGFinancial\" data-show-count=\"false\" data-size=\"large\">Follow @AGFinancial</a></p>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\">// <![CDATA[\n!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');\n// ]]></script></p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>*Tip: One way to save for retirement is through<a href=\"/investments/open-an-investment/open-investment-individuals/\"> AGFinancial Investment Certificates</a>.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>There’s a group of preschoolers sitting at a table with one marshmallow in front of each of them. A trusted authority figure like a parent or a teacher displays a table containing more marshmallows and gives the children two options: they can eat the marshmallow that sits in front of them right now, or they can get another marshmallow—if they wait 20 minutes to eat the one in front of them.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>This scene is from what most people refer to as the “Marshmallow Test.” It was administered in the 1960’s by Walter Mischel, a man who is considered one of the most influential psychologists in modern times.</p>\n<p>After administering this test Mischel waited 20 years to follow up on the subjects of his test. According to <em>The Economist</em>, the ones who waited until they could have 2 marshmallows had higher academic success, better body-mass index, and a better overall psychological wellbeing.</p>\n<p>How can this be applied to educating your child about finances? Encourage self-control when it comes to spending money. According to BLS.gov, the average American took home almost $67,000 before taxes in 2014. That equates to roughly $51,000 after taxes. Of that $51,000, the average American spends $53,000. You can see the full breakdown <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cesan.nr0.htm\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Take a look at our interactive chart to see how that affects the average person's annual gross profit:</p>\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_average_american_taxes_expenses_and_debt\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?NON\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n<div><a href=\"https://infogr.am/average_american_taxes_expenses_and_debt\">Average American Taxes, Expenses, and Debt</a> | <a href=\"https://infogr.am\">Create infographics</a></div>\n<p>It doesn’t take long to see the average person has a very unsustainable financial situation. Luckily, since he first administered the test, Mischel has shown that delayed gratification can be “taught and enhanced.”</p>\n<p>Here are two things you can do to teach your children how to combine delayed gratification with finances.</p>\n<h2>Teach your children to make long-term goals.</h2>\n<p>If your child earns an allowance, explain that they could buy something small today, but if they save their money they’ll be able to buy something larger at a later date. Be sure to encourage and praise your child while he’s waiting. If you wait, he may lose sight of his goal.</p>\n<h2 >Teach your children the difference between “needs” and “wants.”</h2>\n<p>As a parent, you’re probably not making your young child work for his own food and clothing, but it’s good to talk with your child about how your family spends money and budgets the difference between “needs” and “wants.”</p>\n<p>But how exactly do you talk to your kids about finances? We’ll discuss that next week in Part II.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AGFinancial\" data-show-count=\"false\" data-size=\"large\">Follow @AGFinancial</a><br />\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">// <![CDATA[\n!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');\n// ]]></script></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>This is a good time look at your own finances to ensure you are following the principles you want your children to learn.

From the often-mocked “Nigerian prince” emails to the “free offer” banners that mysteriously require a credit card and a small payment, most of us know which emails to open and which ads to avoid clicking on.</p>\n<p>The telephone provides a different experience, though. You can’t see the person you’re talking to and conversations happen in real time so it can be harder to assess the legitimacy of an offer. And telephone fraudsters rely on those elements.</p>\n<p>But how does a telephone scam start?</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=434313813\">NPR</a>, many times fraudsters acquire telephone numbers via stolen lists, and the first thing they do is have a computer call the numbers in that list. If there’s any noise on the other end – someone saying hello, a person breathing, etc. – they know they’ve reached a real person.</p>\n<p><span>\"OK, if you want a moment to process this, we're going to send the law enforcement in front of your doorstep.\"</span></p>\n<p>The next step is impersonating a reputable organization like a bank or a government office, and the fraudsters apply heavy pressure and refuse to give you time to think. Vijay Balasubramaniyan, CEO of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAAahUKEwjY9Jj_0vvHAhWJjg0KHRbvBeM&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pindropsecurity.com%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNGdfm627H-ttNrNIDTV6B__fjtNaA&amp;sig2=JOcJ_Xgvnv5VxPgeLpGNww&amp;bvm=bv.102829193,d.eXY\">Pindrop Security</a> in Atlanta, recalls a scam from 2014: “We last year had this IRS call where they were saying you owe back taxes… they're like OK, if you want a moment to process this, we're going to send the law enforcement in front of your doorstep.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most well known telephone scam group is Cardholder Services. Going to <a href=\"http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/rachel-from-cardholder-services-pays-up-011615.html\">this page</a> and reading people’s experiences in the comment section is alarming. In 2012 the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) declared “Rachel” from Cardholder Services public enemy number one, and in 2015 the FTC mailed 16,590 refund checks totaling more than $700,000 to people who had been tricked by Cardholder Services.</p>\n<p>Most of the time these fraudulent calls start with a robotic voice leaving a recorded message that prompts you to hit “1” on your keypad to speak to a real person. Other times a person will actually contact you, usually from a number that has been spoofed. People who have received calls from the notorious Cardholder Services group have reported the phone number showing up as a spouse or even their own home.</p>\n<p>Another popular scam is calling from what appears to be a long distance number with a legitimate U.S. area code and leaving an urgent voicemail prompting a callback. According to <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2014/02/01/dont-return-calls-from-these-area-codes-its-a-scam/\">Forbes</a>, though, these numbers are not long distance numbers but rather area codes associated with various islands in the Caribbean where a call can cost several dollars per minute. You can view the full list of area codes and countries <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2014/02/01/dont-return-calls-from-these-area-codes-its-a-scam/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, nobody is immune to attempts at telephone fraud since referencing the “do not call” list is something usually reserved for people who are interested in obeying the law. So what do you do if you find yourself in one of these phone calls? Balasubramaniyan says to do some quick research. “Make sure the phone number matches the number on the back of your credit card or debit card or the company's website.” Also, the FTC has provided a <a href=\"http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0076-phone-scams#Protect\">list of questions</a> to ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who is calling and why?</li>\n<li>Why are they demanding an answer right away? Is that what a legitimate business would do?</li>\n<li>If it’s free, why are they asking me to pay?</li>\n<li>Why am I “confirming” my account information — or giving it out?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

Realize that some members of your congregation may not be comfortable with the idea of going in debt. If you are considering a loan purely for “comfort” or “aesthetic” reasons, it may be better to pay in cash or through a capital campaign. When seeking a loan, have a detailed plan on how that money will be used to grow your ministry.</p>\n<h2>Organize Your Finances</h2>\n<p>If your finances aren’t in order, it will be difficult to find someone who is willing to lend you money. Lenders will want to see your cash flow statement. They are taking a risk when they consider giving your church a loan, so maintaining accurate and detailed financial reports will help make the process easier for all parties involved. </p>\n<h2>Get to Know Your Lender</h2>\n<p>After you’ve articulated the plan for your loan and organized your finances, there is one last step: get to know your lender. Share your vision and ask questions. Because of the magnitude and financial impact of this decision, you want to make sure you are comfortable with each other before you pull the trigger on financing ministry growth.</p>\n<p>AGFinancial shares your vision for ministry growth and wants to make the loan process as easy as possible.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>For life insurance, whether you get a great rate or a cost-prohibitive one depends almost entirely on medical underwriting, which considers many health risk factors. You can increase your likelihood of getting the coverage you need at a low price by doing the following:</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>1. Invest in your health</h2>\n<p>This may involve taking steps to resolve underlying health issues if possible and may include diet and exercise changes. For instance, being considered overweight when you apply can negatively impact your rate because you may be at a greater risk for certain diseases than someone who is at a healthy weight.</p>\n<h2>2. Apply at a young age</h2>\n<p>The younger you are the lower your rate will be. Even a few years can make a difference. Every week I speak to someone in need of life insurance who is unable to qualify due to health problems because they have waited until well past retirement age to seek life insurance. If you are seeking long-term coverage at the best possible rate, apply prior to age 50. Although you can—and should—still apply even if you are over age 50, options may be limited and more expensive, especially if you have health problems.</p>\n<h2>3. Time your application well before international travel</h2>\n<p>When underwriting, most insurance companies ask if you have any definitive plans to travel outside the US within the next 12 months. If you will be stateside for at least the next 12 months, you’ll be in a better position to qualify for the best rates.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Special note for missionaries:</strong></em><br />\n<em>Many healthy, young missionaries apply for coverage only to be denied because they will soon be traveling to a foreign hotspot. For them, the best time to purchase coverage is immediately upon return to the U.S. for itineration.</em></p>\n<h2>4. Buy enough coverage</h2>\n<p>Many times people will buy a small policy initially and seek to increase it or upgrade it down the road, mistakenly thinking this will save money in the long run. However, each time you want more coverage you have to go through the complete medical underwriting process again. It is much better to buy enough coverage to meet your needs for the next 10-20 years. A good rule of thumb is to purchase about 10 times your gross annual income, plus debts. This way, you can lock in on good health and favorable underwriting now, rather than facing a possible decline later.</p>\n<h2>5. Adequately insure a non-working spouse</h2>\n<p>If there is only one income earner in the family, you may be tempted to only buy coverage on the breadwinner. Please don’t overlook the value a non-working spouse brings to the family. Although the household income may not be impacted by losing that spouse prematurely, expenses will undoubtedly increase, often quite drastically. Think of the additional cost if you have to pay for daycare, babysitters, or housekeeping. These are things many people fail to calculate when purchasing insurance.</p>\n<p>Although these recommendations do not guarantee a low rate, you stand a much better chance of getting one by following them. If you would like more information on your life insurance options, call <span>866.662.8210</span> or email <a href=\"mailto:info@agfinancialinsurance.com\">info@agfinancialinsurance.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>From her soft-spoken demeanor, 84-year-old Grace Matthews offers no sign of the adventurous life she has lived. In fact, she’s quite content to enjoy the quiet rhythms of daily life in her retirement community in Florida. But the way she found Christ in war-torn Japan was nothing short of miraculous.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Born in Tokyo, Grace, pictured on the right with her older sister, was brought up as a Buddhist. “I remember they would take me to the temples. It didn’t make any sense to me, but we worshipped the Buddha.”</p>\n<p>She was only 12 during World War II when she began having to work in a factory several days a week. “It was very difficult. Every morning I left, I thought, maybe I’ll never see my mother again. And I’m sure my mother felt the same way—my daughter will never come home.”</p>\n<p>Once there was a bomb threat while she was on one of the trains she had to take to the factory. The train stopped, and she had to get off, alone and terribly frightened. “I didn’t know where to go, so I ran to a Buddhist temple.”</p>\n<p>As a teenager, she excelled at English, and a teacher asked if she would like to study it in depth. She agreed, so the teacher directed her to a church near her home that offered English classes as an outreach ministry. One night a born-again GI came to teach the class. “I couldn’t believe the American GI was a ’Nisei’—second generation Japanese,” she said. After the class, he invited her and a friend to come to a GI Gospel Hour in downtown Tokyo.</p>\n<p>She recalls, “This was February 26, a cold, cold night, and we went, my girlfriend and I.” That night they heard the beautiful old hymns of the church for the first time, songs she loves to this day. Then American missionary Mabel Francis spoke.</p>\n<p>“There were about 700 people—GIs, missionaries, Japanese people young and old,” says Grace. “She spoke in Japanese and gave us the invitation to accept Jesus. My friend and I thought, ‘If we don’t take this chance, we’ll never have another.’ We gave our hearts to the Lord.”</p>\n<p>She met her husband, Clayton Matthews, an American GI from Detroit, while working at an ordinance factory in Japan. They married in 1956 and then came to America. Sadly, Clayton passed away at age 38, but Grace remained in the States, working for 27 years for the Massey Ferguson company. She moved to Lakeland, Florida, in 1992.</p>\n<p>Now in retirement, Grace still desires to share her resources to help others find the hope she has in Christ. Her Gift Annuity with AGFinancial will help her do that, while providing for her current needs. “Missionaries are very, very important to me,” she said. “If they hadn’t come to Japan, I wonder where I would be. So when God takes me home, I want money to be spent for missionaries to preach the gospel.”</p>\n<p>Hers is a life lived well and fully in Christ and a legacy that will continue for many years to come. “I’m 84 years old, and someday, how soon I don’t know, God is going to use this money to build His kingdom.”</p>\n<p>Listen to her inspiring story and learn why she has chosen to share that hope with others through a <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/planned-giving/planned-giving-tools/gift-annuities/\">Charitable Gift Annuity</a>.</p>\n<div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ISkGxiwmJS0?feature=oembed\" width=\"639\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

Walk people through how to set up an online giving profile. </li>\n<li>Teach on stewardship and generosity to the whole church at least once a year.

Show an example budget that includes automated giving. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Market It</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be sure to promote the electronic giving option effectively on your communication materials.</li>\n<li>Don’t just have an online giving button - add online giving to your website’s main navigation. A button or special promotion on specific pages is great, but it can get lost. Use creative communication tools to promote the electronic giving option – videos, social networks, blogs, emails, etc.</li>\n<li>Share testimonies that tie electronic giving to the impact that the vision of the church or organization is having.</li>\n<li>When you have a series on stewardship and generosity, include a digital giving challenge. If you normally use a commitment card, then gather email addresses from the card and on Monday send people a note of encouragement and a clickable link where they can sign up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Support It</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you make a big push for electronic giving, offer to have support staff available to walk people through setting up their account. </li>\n<li>Do some user testing by watching people interact with all the points of your electronic process. Is it hard for them to find it on your website? Do people have trouble increasing the amount they give when they get a raise? Is it hard for people to know who to contact if they run into a problem? Do people know your site is secure? Is your electronic giving card glossy and causing ink to smear? By observing people actually use your process you can learn a lot.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Give biblical based reasons why people should give. Make sure you include a variety of reasons, not just the same couple of reasons over and over again. Include those reasons, the organization’s vision, and testimonies in the online giving section of the website.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>AGFinancial helps ministries bridge the gap to their vision by creating a movement of generosity within your organization. Part of this process involves making sure that it is simple for people to financially partner with you. Electronic giving is one effective way to develop a broad base of financial ministry supporters. However, it’s not as simple as just having e-giving or online giving as an option. You need a strategy, a solution, and effective process that support your electronic giving. Here are the first three of ten suggestions to help boost your organization’s electronic giving.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>Have a Simple Solution</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you have a simple, effective, secure, and easy-to-use system in place. A good system should allow people to easily track and change their giving. If they want to increase their monthly donations or start to give money to missions it should be simple.</li>\n<li>Make sure your system supports and focuses on reoccurring giving. </li>\n<li>If you have a service in place, ask your people what they like and dislike about it. Use that feedback to improve it.</li>\n<li>If you do not offer online and onsite electronic options, then do some research on best practices in that field or let us recommend some options to you to get this established. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Talk About It</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>During your offering window, be sure to include discussion on electronic giving. Let people know it is an option.</li>\n<li>When you have a special need come up, let people know they can give electronically. Sometimes people assume that if they don’t have cash then they can’t be involved.</li>\n<li>Share how you personally use electronic giving and/or talk about how people are using it. For example, \"I schedule my tithes to automatically come out of my bank account, but I still give offerings during the worship service. How are you using electronic giving?\" </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Thank People Who Use It</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you thank people for giving in the offering, acknowledge those who have given online or have scheduled their support.</li>\n<li>When people sign up to give online or schedule reoccurring donations, be sure to send out a purposeful thank you email. Share how they are supporting the vision.</li>\n<li>When you have something like a snowstorm that forces you to cancel services, take the time to send out an email to the congregation thanking those who have still supported the ministry by giving online or scheduling their giving. Explain how reoccurring gifts enable ministry to still go on even though services are cancelled. (Outreach, warming center, food supplies, benevolence, disaster response, etc.) If you don’t send out an email, then just mention it in the next service. Show pictures of the ministry that occurred. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Finances are tight these days, even in growing churches. However, in the words of pioneer missionary Hudson Taylor, “God’s work, done in God’s way, will never lack God’s supplies.” So when the time comes to build a new facility to reach more people for Christ, we should anticipate receiving both God’s provision and His wisdom.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>One of the most important ways God gives insight is through prayerful planning. The value of partnering with God in planning is woven throughout Scripture. In fact, more than 90 passages refer to planning. In this 3-part blog series, we'll highlight the blessings that come from the good planning for your future facility.</p>\n<p><strong>Planning helps clarify your thinking.</strong> Before you hire an architect or contractor, know what you can afford to pay right now for a building. Do not fall into the trap of, “If we build it they will come.” This may work in the movies. But when it comes to church buildings the reality is, “If we build it, they will visit.”</p>\n<p>To determine what you can afford, start with how much cash you have saved. Then add the extra funds you can set aside, raise through a capital campaign, or save by holding down nonessential expenses. Then, and only then, calculate how much money you can safely afford to borrow to complete the entire project.</p>\n<p>Do this <em>before</em> you put up a picture in the foyer or turn a shovel of dirt. Be sure that any loan amount you consider can be made with payments you can afford right now. One of the biggest reasons for our national economic crisis was millions of people making borrowing decisions that assumed real estate values and incomes would always go up. <em>Bad thinking = Bad planning.</em> Even in a ministry context that kind of assumption is not faith, it’s presumption. Your plan has a very high probablitity of succeeding if you plan with wisdom.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Regardless of the scope of your project, it can be difficult to know how to start. We work with hundreds of churches each year on everything from minor improvement projects to major purchase and construction projects. In partnering with these churches, we have found the following seven steps to be instrumental to a successful project. </p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>Let Ministry Be Your Foundation</strong><br />Before you even break ground on your new project, take a step back and consider: <em>who</em> are you as a church, <em>what</em> has God called you to do, and <em>how </em>should that calling shape your facilities? Every church is unique in their personality, culture, calling, and ministries. Plan through the filter of the <em>who, what</em>, and <em>how. </em>Always let ministry need drive the process. Psalm 127 is very clear in this, “Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labor in vain.”</p>\n<p><strong>Consider <em>All</em> Your Resources</strong><br />Beyond your ministry needs, focus on fitting your project into your expected budget. A project that is out of control financially can be devastating to the ministries of a church. Every project should be planned and designed in a way that maintains adequate resources for the ministries of the church. Remember that resources extend beyond the dollars spent to include time, energy, and the ability for your staff and pastors to focus. Factor in more than just the financial cost of the project.</p>\n<p><strong>Understand Your Areas of Funding<br /></strong>Church project funding usually comes from three sources: money you have, money you raise, and money you borrow. It is essential to the continuity of your ministry that you keep your project within the confines of your source funds.</p>\n<p><strong>Carefully Count the Cost<br /></strong>It is important to go through careful cost planning so you can stay within your construction budget as much as possible. Jesus spoke to this in Luke 14:28 when He said, “Which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?” Construction costs are generally organized into divisions – concrete, lumber, doors, etc. It is important to accurately budget for each division. Underestimating the value of a division, overspending in one or more divisions, missing a division altogether, or making unplanned changes to a project are four of the most common reasons a project exceeds its budget. As you sit down to determine the cost, consider the three main categories of expenses: hard costs (construction labor and material), soft costs (professional services, fees, permits, etc.), and FFE costs (furniture, fixtures, and equipment). Building projects often exceed the construction budget because the soft and FFE costs are not considered into the equation. As a best practice, estimate the soft and FFE costs <em>first</em>, and then design the project around the remaining budgeted hard cost amount.</p>\n<p><strong>Know Your Parameters<br /></strong>What are your limitations? Funding, land use and size, building coverage, budget, etc. Define your limits and plan your project within those parameters. When purchasing land or building a new building, a civil engineer should be one of the first people you consult. A civil engineer will identify the development parameters of a site. Also discuss your project with a lending institution. They will help determine your financial parameters in regards to debt capacity. A stewardship or capital campaign consultant can help you estimate how much you can raise. Keep in mind that the campaign funds you receive are typically a smaller percentage than the originally pledged funds and are generally submitted over a two to three year period. Finally, a local contractor can usually advise on construction cost per square foot factors in your area (these estimates should only be used as a guide and not a true determination of cost). Be realistic about the funding you will have in hand and take that into consideration as you define your parameters. Once your parameters are determined, refine the scope of the project until it fits within your limits. This process will help guide your project towards a successful end. </p>\n<p><strong>Phase Your Master Plan<br /></strong>God approached creation very systematically and intentionally, completing the work in six “phases”. He also completed each phase in a day, had an unlimited budget, and didn’t have building inspectors to deal with, but that’s another story… the point is, a master plan ensures that you eventually complete everything necessary (like all of creation), while phasing allows you to systematically and intentionally complete it one step at a time (each of the six days). To that end, develop your master plan by identifying the best use for your property and facilities according to your ministry needs. Then break your master plan into attainable steps. Each phase should be somewhat self-contained so that you have realistic and affordable steps that fit within your currently defined parameters. Phasing in this way will make your project easier to fund and manage as you work towards completing your master plan. </p>\n<p><strong>Count the Cost Again<br /></strong>In the beginning stages of planning and design, it is common for a project to seem a bit out of focus and vague. Rather than concerning yourself with fully understanding the outcome, focus instead on counting the cost as accurately as possible. Make sure to cushion your budget with a contingency factor for unforeseen costs. Keep revisiting your budget and making necessary adjustments as details of your project are defined. Even after the blueprints are complete, the contracts are signed, and construction is underway, the cost to complete your project should always be monitored relative to your available funding. </p>\n<p>Your facilities are an important tool for you to accomplish what God has called you to do. By following these seven steps, you will be well on your way to a smoother project. Proper planning for your project will enable you to <strong>reap the benefits and grow your ministry</strong> without compromising the stability of your organization.</p>\n<p>What steps have you found to be critical for a construction or improvement project?<strong> </strong>Share your tips below.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>I like the simplicity of the popular nutrition book series <em>Eat This, Not That</em> by David Zinczenko and Matt Goulding. Rather than presenting a one-size-fits-all solution, it educates readers about healthier alternatives to common food choices. My goal in this post is similar. While there is no single solution or magic formula that applies to your building program, below are some “do this, not that” tips to consider as you prayerfully approach your project.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\n<img alt=\"Church Construction Best Practices\" border=\"0\" id=\"img-1346365057280\" src=\"//cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/25853/file-335042572-png/images/church-construction-best-practices.png\"><br />\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Do This:</em> Address immediate needs first.<br /></strong><strong><em>Not That:</em> Jump into a construction project and then find out that you need to replace the roof, three air conditioners, and a church van.</strong></p>\n<p>Do an in-depth inspection of your facilities and their systems. Are there major deferred maintenance or repair issues that need to be addressed? Identify the issues and associated costs, and then make a plan. Leaving these items unattended can impact a building budget and/or general fund, causing negative ripple effects. Aim to address all immediate needs prior to exerting funds on a new project.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Do This:</em> Maximize the benefit of your existing space before expanding.<br /></strong><strong><em>Not That:</em> Dismiss your current facilities because they are old, outdated, or seem dysfunctional.</strong></p>\n<p>It is important to fully utilize the space you have before starting a new building project. I once worked with a church that seemed to have outgrown their facilities, so they hired an architect. The architect, in turn, designed a $1.5 million sanctuary building. This would have been a wonderful solution <em>if</em> the church needed a sanctuary and <em>if</em> they could afford $1.5 million. Instead, they needed kids ministry and fellowship space, and their budget was $300,000. As we looked through their existing facilities, we determined that the basement level of the church was completely underutilized. With some strategic planning, we were able to help them renovate that space to meet their current ministry needs, all within their $300,000 budget.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Do This:</em> Fully understand what you are buying and its limitations.<br /></strong><strong><em>Not That:</em> Assume you can move into an existing building and have service the next day or that you can build anything on the property you’re purchasing</strong>.</p>\n<p>Whether buying land or an existing building, make sure you understand exactly what you can and cannot do with your purchase. Always get a full property inspection report when purchasing an existing building. There may be maintenance, repair, zoning, or code compliance issues that could throw the entire project off track financially and otherwise. If you’re buying land, consult with a civil engineer before purchasing the property. In certain situations, both for land and existing buildings, an environmental study may be necessary. Finally, confirm your intentions with the local building authority. Taking these precautions will help ensure that your purchasing decision is in line with your expectations.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Do This: </em> Plan, bid, and plan some more.<br /></strong><strong><em>Not That:</em> Build or purchase land with assumed (or no) costs in mind.</strong></p>\n<p>Regardless of the scope of your project, define it as much as possible. Don’t begin without a firm plan and get firm bids throughout the process. For construction projects, carry a minimum ten percent contingency for cost overruns. Keep in mind that construction cost overruns are a <em>when</em> item not an <em>if</em> item. In other words, plan ahead. I have worked with many churches that are burdened with vacant land because they can’t afford to build on it. Others embark on a project with false assumptions about cost per square foot, resulting in an incomplete, inoperative building. In each of these scenarios, the church was seeking to meet their growing ministry needs. Instead, improper planning and false assumptions hindered rather than helped the church meet their needs. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Do This: </em> Know what you can afford.<br /></strong><strong><em>Not That:</em> Design a project that exceeds your budget.</strong></p>\n<p>Most church building projects are a combination of at least two of three sources of funding: cash on hand, a capital campaign, and financing. Determine your financial parameters up front and design the project within those limits. Overspending will have far greater consequences than limiting your project to the confines of your budget.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Do This:</em> Consider your unique calling.<br /></strong><strong><em>Not That: </em> Copy something another church has done. </strong></p>\n<p>Every ministry is unique and has an equally unique calling. Make every building decision through the lens of who you are as a church and what God has called you to do. Before you make a single decision or spend one dollar on your new building project, take time to step back and define the vision and resulting needs of your ministry. Then design, plan, and build your facilities with that vision in mind. You don’t need more of the wrong type of space – you need what will meet your needs. Don't make the mistake of assuming that what worked for the church down the road will work for you. From assessing your needs to opening the doors of your new space, let God and His calling for your ministry guide you throughout the building process. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Do This:</em> Consider the big picture – inside and out.<br /></strong><strong><em>Not That:</em> Focus your entire budget on the design and structure.</strong></p>\n<p>Too often, money from a construction budget goes to fund the design or aesthetics of a structure without considering if the size or purpose of the structure meets the needs of the ministry. Budget items beyond construction such as insurance, city fees, chairs, sound, lighting, and video systems must also be considered. These items are not typically within the contractor’s responsibility. Figure these items into your budget from the beginning.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Do This:</em> Enjoy the process.</strong></p>\n<p>A new building or renovation project is an exciting time for your church. You have the unique opportunity to watch your prayerfully considered project unfold and meet the needs of your growing ministry. In spite of the excitement, however, the process can sometimes be both overwhelming and intimidating.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>As one who often travels by air, I’ve learned to accept the frustration of delays and be thankful someone is addressing critical issues before the plane takes off. The same is true with church building projects.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>The most important factor in keeping a church building project on time, on track, and on budget is to make sure you are completely ready before starting — even if that means delaying the start date. <strong>It is extremely difficult to realign a project that starts poorly.</strong> Take the following into consideration before you begin: </p>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<p>Insist your project be designed within the parameters of what you can afford. A good design-build firm will make this much easier than the traditional method of starting with an architect and then taking their design to a contractor to price.</p>\n<h3>Plans</h3>\n<p>Ensure the plans fully match the church’s needs and desires <strong>before they are submitted to the city or a contractor</strong>. This will minimize change orders during construction. In addition, ensure your design contract puts the burden of compliance with building code and jurisdictional review changes on the designer, not the church. </p>\n<h3>Contract</h3>\n<p>A contract and project price should be based on the final set of drawings as approved and permitted by the local building authority and all final design decisions of the church. Avoid “allowance” items and insist on a contract with a maximum or “not-to-exceed” price. Make sure the contract does not allow final payment until a certificate of occupancy is in place — the official document declaring the building is complete, safe, and ready to be used for its intended purpose.</p>\n<h3>Schedule of Values/Project Budget</h3>\n<p>A full schedule of values (SOV) or detailed budget with the breakdown of each line item should accompany the contract. Require the contractor to show you actual bids. Be sure to include items such as seating, sound system, and other equipment.</p>\n<h3>Contingency</h3>\n<p>This is a financial safety net built into the budget. The recommended amount is equal to 10% of hard construction costs to cover unforeseen costs outside the church’s or contractor’s control. A contingency ensures some funds are available beyond the line-item budget, if needed.</p>\n<h3>Critical Path Schedule</h3>\n<p>The contract should include a timeline of completion with pre-determined milestone dates for completion of major scopes of work or inspections. The contract should bind the contractor to complete these milestones throughout the project.</p>\n<h3>Disbursing Payment</h3>\n<p>Compliance with the critical path schedule is easily achieved when the contractor’s payment is tied to meeting milestones. The contractor’s billing should comply with the cost of each line item on the SOV or project budget. If there is a potential cost overrun or change order, this should first be priced and considered for source of payment. Payment should follow work and not exceed the percentage of completion for each line item.</p>\n<h3>Project Management/Owner’s Representative</h3>\n<p>It is frustrating for contractors and subcontractors to deal with multiple points of contact and can slow progress. Appoint a single representative who is responsible for the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>monitoring the project</li>\n<li>reviewing pay applications</li>\n<li>holding the contractor accountable</li>\n<li>representing the interests of the church, board and pastor</li>\n<li>acting as liaison between contractor/church </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Construction projects are challenging to manage and control, but following these guidelines will prepare your church for a smooth process.</p>\n<p>For more information about church building projects, call 866.621.1787 to speak with one of our consultants.</p>\n<p><em>Shawn Fink consults with churches across the country as they expand their ministries and facilities.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>As online banking grows ever more common, implementing an electronic giving system for your church can help increase generosity by making it easy for people to give.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>Consider the following:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>80% of U.S. households utilize direct deposits, online banking, and or online transactions</li>\n<li>54% of smart phone users are active mobile bankers</li>\n<li>Millions of dollars are now being donated through onsite giving kiosks</li>\n<li>Online donors are more generous than offline</li>\n<li>The average age of online donors is around 40, much younger than offline donors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are thinking of putting electronic giving into place at your church, here are answers to some frequently asked questions:</p>\n<h4><strong>What are the capabilities and limitations of online giving?</strong></h4>\n<p>Online giving represents an additional way people can partner with your ministry, but surprisingly only 14% of U.S. Protestant churches offer it. With online giving, you can engage a broader audience than what you may be used to on a typical Sunday morning. In addition, it can give you actionable information about people who might have previously been anyonymous cash-only givers—information you can use to deepen your relationship with these ministry partners. Keep in mind, however, that online giving cannot replace a face-to-face relationship with your church or organization, and it cannot be a substitute for discipling people to become more like Christ in their attitude of generosity.</p>\n<h4><strong>How can online giving save time for church staff and volunteers?</strong></h4>\n<p>The primary goal of electronic giving is to expand the kingdom of God, not to necessarily add convenience, but that is a great byproduct. While people can still give offerings onsite as a part of worship, an electronic giving system can allow them to automate their recurring tithe, missions, and other giving. This can shorten the time spent by staff and volunteers counting and depositing funds manually. Good electronic giving software can also automate some accounting processes. For instance, some service providers offer systems that allow funds to be directly deposited into church bank accounts, making funds available quickly.</p>\n<h4><strong>What factors should we consider when choosing an online giving service provider?</strong></h4>\n<p>Consider what types of electronic giving you want to offer and giving methods you want to deploy such as text giving, kiosks, website, social networking integration, and updated offering envelopes that point people to the electronic system. Then consider what service provider best fits your needs and is compatible with your current accounting and management systems. In addition, look for a solution that fits your church’s culture.</p>\n<h4><strong>Can't we just add a PayPal option to our website?</strong></h4>\n<p>PayPal can be a good first step, but the best options will add value for people and the church and can be customized to look like your church’s website. In addition, good electronic giving software systems offer the capability for both one-time and recurring transactions. There are many service providers with a ministry mindset who offer solutions with features and options that can benefit your church now and down the road. Alternatively, you may give people the option to choose between using PayPal and the church’s chosen service provider.</p>\n<h4><strong>Who are some of the electronic giving service providers?</strong></h4>\n<p>To become familiar with the many options available to your church, check out the service provider links below.

Consider getting an outside perspective or a coach to help you develop an e-giving strategy.</p>\n<p>Make sure you develop your plan for electronic giving within a larger context of a biblically based culture of generosity. The goal is to develop faithful stewards and to maximize the impact of your church.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Pastors Rob Ketterling of River Valley Church in Minnesota and Herbert Cooper of Peoples Church in Oklahoma know a thing or two about church budgeting and ministry growth. <!--more-->If you’re wondering how to balance smart financial principles with faith when it comes to the budget, here are five practices that have served these pastors well:</p>\n<h2>1. Identify the gap</h2>\n<p>Ketterling says, “I believe there should always be a gap between what you want to do and what you need.”</p>\n<p>A general rule of thumb is to budget off of 80% of the church’s income (tithes and offerings) and put the rest in <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/cash-reserves-how-much-does-your-ministry-need/\">reserve</a>. But as a leader, you may be called to dream outside financial comfort zones. Ask yourself, what has God placed in your heart to do, what do you need, and what’s the gap? </p>\n<h2>2. Set realistic goals that stretch faith</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve identified a financial gap, it’s time to set goals. However, presenting a goal that’s completely unrealistic can discourage your congregation.</p>\n<p>According to Ketterling, most churches have three kinds of gaps: small “forecasting” gaps, larger “faith” gaps, and unrealistic “foolish” gaps, which are probably best kept between you and God rather than shared with your church. By presenting your forecasting and faith gaps, you’ll be able to effectively lead your congregation toward the vision and stretch their faith without breaking it.</p>\n<h2>3. Design a budget that lets you save toward goals</h2>\n<p>Faith and smart money practices are not mutually exclusive. A <a href=\"http://blog.agfinancial.org/church-budget-template\">church budget</a> is imperative for helping you reach goals while protecting you against unexpected expenses.</p>\n<div id=\"pullquote\">Have a plan in the budget for the next dream that’s been placed in your heart.</div>\n<p>“Don’t spend all you bring in,” Cooper advises. “Give. Put some away for a rainy day. Have a plan in the budget for the next dream that’s been placed in your heart, while you’re casting vision and believing in faith and raising money.”</p>\n<h2>4. Monitor budget performance</h2>\n<p>Don’t let months go by without checking your budget’s performance. Regularly monitoring bank statements and expenses allows you to see areas that may need adjustment. The goal is to make sure you are staying well within the church’s income and allocating resources according to ministry needs and goals.</p>\n<p>“I had a pastor tell me, ‘Always keep your eye on the money,’” says Cooper. “I don’t want just a report given to me. Show me the bank statement. I’m not going to go five months and ask, ‘How are we doing?’”</p>\n<h2>5. Connect givers to the church vision</h2>\n<p>Proactively share the church vision with specific people in your congregation, challenging them to support it through strategic giving that goes beyond tithing.</p>\n<p>Each year River Valley Church invites people to become “kingdom builders.” Ketterling simply tells them, “Here’s what we know we’re going to bring in. Here’s what we want to do. You’re here as a part of this to close the gap so we can do what’s in our heart.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, balancing smart church budgeting with faith is a continual process. These five practices can help keep your church on track toward the goals God has put in your heart. </p>\n<p>Ketterling says, “Someday you’re going to need to step out in faith. You don’t want just a comfortable, forecasting church. You want a church that’s been stretched and can budget for growth in faith.”<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>For more information, call 866.621.1787 or email <a href=\"mailto:info@agfinancial.org\">info@agfinancial.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Prior to starting the loan application process, it is important for pastors and church boards to understand the factors considered by lenders when evaluating you for a church loan. Although specific underwriting criteria vary, most lenders evaluate church borrowers in three broad areas: character, cash flow, and collateral.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Character</h2>\n<p>Most lenders place considerable emphasis on assessing the overall character of the borrower. Specifically, will the church honor its commitment to repay the loan? In evaluating this measure, lenders look for a long history of operations, a good credit history, and strong, committed church leadership.</p>\n<h2>Cash Flow</h2>\n<p>The second focus is on cash flow. Lenders want to see a track record of positive income and attendance trends as well as a positive operating margin (revenues in excess of operating expenses). Flat or declining attendance or income can be a concern, and operating losses mean that it may be difficult for the church to absorb a monthly mortgage payment within its budget.</p>\n<h2>Collateral</h2>\n<p>Finally, lenders need to know that the amount of collateral (real property such as land and buildings that will secure the loan) is sufficient to repay the loaned funds in the unlikely event of default.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in securing a church loan, you will be better able to obtain favorable rates and terms by demonstrating strong performance in each of these areas.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>A church with an attendance of 100 has different needs than a church of 1,000. As you move through different growth stages, make sure you are aware of and plan for the following:</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h1>Risks associated with church size</h1>\n<h3>Smaller churches</h3>\n<p>One difficulty small churches may face is a lack of professional expertise within the congregation who can offer guidance in matters of risk management. For example, small churches may not have an attorney or Certified Public Accountant (CPA) who would normally assist with financial internal controls and tax issues. Lacking these kinds of internal resources can expose your church to greater risk. If your church is on the small side, consider seeking outside assistance, especially regarding legal and financial matters.</p>\n<h3>Larger churches</h3>\n<p>According to church law expert and attorney Richard Hammar, churches of 500 to 750 tend to have the greatest risk of litigation. This could be because many churches in this demographic may have recently experienced significant growth. When you grow quickly, risk management procedures and protocols often don’t keep pace with that growth. If this describes your church, it’s important to focus on risk management. For help in this area, check out our many <a href=\"/insurance/risk-management/\">risk management resources</a>.</p>\n<h3>The number one risk for every church</h3>\n<p>The number one risk for a church of any size is sexual abuse of a minor. The best way to protect children and teens is to properly screen volunteers. Unfortunately, smaller churches are traditionally weak in this area, with only 21% of those under 100 reporting they practice proper screening, which includes both criminal background and reference checks. This may be because at a small church, everyone knows everyone, and it feels wrong to suggest someone should be screened. However, by failing to screen, small churches face the same staggering risk of liability as large churches in terms of the potential financial outcome of a single child molestation claim.</p>\n<p>Although larger churches are more likely to screen, those over 1,000 are about five times more likely to have a sexual misconduct claim than churches of 100 or less, according to Hammar. In addition to simply needing more stringent protections for children, larger churches must be aware of their tendency toward an unhealthy culture, in which questionable behaviors may be tolerated due to fear when they should be challenged.</p>\n<h1>Insurance considerations</h1>\n<h3>Exclusions</h3>\n<p>Most liability insurance policies exclude intentional or criminal misconduct from coverage. In considering insurance companies, find out how they interpret this exclusion. Specifically, are negligence claims against the church in cases of child molestation excluded from coverage? If a company indicates that such claims would be excluded, keep shopping.</p>\n<h3>Limits</h3>\n<p>You may have heard it said that the more activities you have involving minors, the higher your liability limits should be. But how high exactly? In general, you should have liability limits at least equaling the net assets of the church.</p>\n<p>The one exception to this guideline is sexual misconduct coverage. It’s recommended to obtain at least $1 million in this type of coverage, regardless of the net asset value of the church. Usually, in order to be approved for this amount, you must show the insurance company that you have implemented recommended screening procedures.</p>\n<p>As your church grows, be prepared to reassess all insurance limits, increasing them as needed.</p>\n<h1>Facility expansion considerations</h1>\n<h3>Financial statements</h3>\n<p>At a certain growth point, space becomes an issue, and a church must consider expanding its facilities. It’s usually necessary to finance at least a portion of the project, but you’ll want to obtain the best possible terms. To do so, make sure your church is in the <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/church-loans-are-you-a-good-borrowing-candidate/\">best possible financial position</a> before talking to a lender.</p>\n<p>Once you’re ready to pursue financing, having accurate and properly prepared financial statements, usually provided by a CPA, is key. Presenting improperly prepared or incomplete financials can hinder your ability to borrow at a favorable rate.</p>\n<h3>Uninsured contractors</h3>\n<p>Small churches may be tempted to complete some or all of an expansion project using their own volunteers from the congregation. Although using volunteers can cut costs, it is still recommended to hire a licensed bonded general contractor for liability reasons. This way, you may still be able to use your own people for certain tasks, but the contractor’s insurance, not the church’s, would provide protection if something were to happen.</p>\n<p>In addition, sometimes builders start a job but are unable to finish it. Avoid being left with a half-finished project by asking for a completion bond from the builder before construction begins.</p>\n<p>To learn about additional issues growing churches face, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiKrW8eX2MQ&amp;index=15&amp;list=PLS35Et-nHKCyBb23R2pHbuDu-YmGETdQT\">watch the full Risk Mgmt LIVE discussion</a> here.</p>\n<p>If you’ll soon need to expand your facilities or renovate, call 866.621.1787 to speak with a church loan consultant or email <a href=\"mailto:loans@agfinancial.org\">loans@agfinancial.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Spring cleaning offers an opportunity to address parts of your house, like the garage or basement, that may get neglected during the rest of the year. Your finances can use an occasional deep cleaning too. Use the following tips to clear out the clutter and restore order to your financial house:</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Review and reprioritize goals</h2>\n<p>Goals give purpose to your financial life and keep you focused on the big picture. At least once a year you should take time to proactively identify your most important financial goals in relation to your current and foreseeable needs. As a general guideline, building an emergency fund, paying off high-interest credit card debt, and saving for retirement should be high up on the list if they're not already. If you'll be receiving a tax refund this spring, give yourself a jump start by using the money toward one or more of your goals, and then think about adjusting your withholding so that you’re not giving Uncle Sam an interest-free loan for the upcoming year.</p>\n<h2>Organize money clutter by implementing a budget</h2>\n<p>Without an organized system, household mail can quickly pile up and leave you scrambling to find important items when you need them. It's the same with finances. Without a system to organize money coming in each month, it's easy to lose track of how much you're spending and thus, fail to make progress toward your goals. You may even be left scrambling to find needed funds during emergencies. Regular budgeting is the solution. It's the process of making a plan for how you will spend income beforehand.</p>\n<p>If you already have a budget, take time to evaluate it and make sure it is still working for you. A budget is a dynamic thing. You may need to tweak it occasionally to better reflect your family’s needs.</p>\n<p>To help you do this, we have a new tool available for download below: the Household Budget Template and Spending Tracker. Take advantage of this free tool to build a budget that works for your family.</p>\n<h2>Make any needed repairs to your insurance coverage</h2>\n<p>Insurance provides necessary protection to maintain your family’s financial strength if life presents an unexpected challenge, such as the death or disability of a primary household wage earner. One of the most important tasks you can undertake is evaluating all current insurance policies to ensure adequate coverage. For example, experts usually consider adequate life insurance coverage to equal roughly 10 times your annual salary. Also consider whether you need to obtain additional types of insurance, such as disability or long-term care.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/insurance/request-a-quote/\">Request a quote.</a></p>\n<h2 >Additional to-dos: purge files and update record-keeping systems</h2>\n<p>Go through your files, sorting old pay stubs and other items you may no longer need, being careful to retain all tax records and insurance policies. Be sure to properly shred these documents to protect yourself against identity theft. This may also be a great time to try out a new financial app or software. If you’ve been a pen-and-paper kind of person up till now, you just may be pleasantly surprised by the outcome. After all, spring is a time of renewal. By implementing even a few of these tips, you’ll be breathing new life into your finances.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

Since every church is unique, taking time to prayerfully answer the following six questions before <!--more--> you call an architect, contractor, or lender will help put you on the right track to planning a successful project that meets the needs of your ministry. </p>\n<p><strong>1. What is the unique calling of your church?<br /></strong>Let your unique ministry calling lead your church expansion project so your facilities meet both your current and future needs.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Are the vision and goals of your ministry well defined?</strong><br />What are the core needs of your ministry? Where are your largest growth areas? To plan a project that will meet the future needs of your ministry, your goals need to be well defined. By articulating the vision, you will have a benchmark from which to make decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Are you fully utilizing your current space?</strong><br />Before you commit to building, ensure you are maximizing your current space. Assess how your facilities are being used and search for creative ways to better utilize them. </p>\n<p><strong>4. Have you considered alternative options to expanding?</strong><br />Adding services or making minor renovations may provide additional time to plan and save for a larger expansion project that may better meet your future goals.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How will your new facilities be shaped by your church vision?</strong><br />Your facilities should be designed with ministry functions and activities in mind. This is where creativity and innovation come in. Many churches purchase and renovate existing buildings—corporate offices, warehouses, storefronts, etc. Others build new buildings, designed specifically for their needs. Whatever you choose, make sure your ministry vision will be served.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Can you afford to expand?</strong><br />Can your church afford to build right now or would it be best to wait?

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Financial Literacy Month—the perfect time to focus on better managing your personal finances for the good of your family’s future. You don’t need a degree in finance to manage money well, but you do need to master some basics. The first step is to find out where you stand.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>The following four numbers will help give you a clear picture of your current finances:</p>\n<h2>1. Expected monthly income</h2>\n<p>By knowing how much money you have to work with, you can better plan your spending to stay within that amount. If you have regular paychecks of the same amount each time, it’s easy to identify your monthly income by simply adding them up to get the total. However, if you are paid irregularly, or the amount varies, this can be trickier. Obtain as accurate of a number as possible by looking at previous income you’ve received and carefully basing future income estimates accordingly.</p>\n<h2>2. Total debt</h2>\n<p>Debt is one of the most significant obstacles to achieving financial goals. If you have a lot of debt, especially from credit cards, it’s important to prioritize paying it down. The first step is to find out exactly how much you owe.</p>\n<h2>3. Net worth</h2>\n<p>Net worth is a measurement of your wealth, and it’s a number that can change depending on your current financial situation. It’s calculated by adding up all your assets (things you own, money you have in savings, etc.) and then subtracting all your debts from that number. Use <a href=\"http://www.financialliteracymonth.com/30Steps/Step8.aspx\">this simple worksheet</a> to calculate your current net worth.</p>\n<h2>4. Credit score</h2>\n<p>Your credit score is important because banks and other lenders use it to decide whether or not to give you a loan. If you have a low credit score, you may not qualify for a loan at all, or you may qualify but be required to pay a higher interest rate. Knowing your credit score gives you the heads up to be able to take steps to improve it if it’s low and maintain it if it’s high. Credit scores are based on the information in your credit report so you will want to check it annually to ensure all the reported information is correct. You can obtain free credit reports at <a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\">annualcreditreport.com</a>.</p>\n<h2>Next Step: Establish priorities and goals</h2>\n<p>Once you have a good idea of your current financial situation based on the above numbers, it’s time to evaluate your spending priorities. A good approach is to make a list of all the things you need or want to do with your money such as paying down debt, saving for a car or house, taking a family vacation, or saving for retirement. Designate each item as either a need or a want and then rank in order of importance. For example, if you have a large amount of debt, it’s a good idea to make paying it down a higher priority than saving for a vacation.</p>\n<p>Next, use this priority list to decide your short-, mid-, and long-term financial goals. For example, a short-term goal could be to start building your emergency fund by opening an <a href=\"/investments/types-of-investments/\">AGFinancial Demand Certificate</a> and begin regularly contributing to it. A mid-term goal could be to continue building that emergency savings until it contains three to six months of household expenses. A long-term goal could be to save enough for retirement.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Financial Literacy Month is about increasing your ability to achieve the financial goals that are important to you. Knowing your numbers is the first step. Take time this month to identify where you stand and make a plan for moving forward.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Good planning for a church building project starts with defining your needs and goals and results in a clearly defined project scope within an affordable budget. To achieve this, most churches need to bring in the professionals sooner rather than later. <!--more--> Here’s how to best utilize architects, contractors, and lenders early in the planning process.</p>\n<h2>Architects and Professional Designers</h2>\n<p><strong>What to request:</strong> Preliminary design</p>\n<p>A preliminary design will help you establish project parameters. Although this won’t give you firm pricing for a project, it is usually enough to determine a cost range. But be careful not to let an architect’s design be the driving force. Instead, let ministry need and your church’s vision drive the project. </p>\n<h2>Contractors and Design-Build Firms</h2>\n<p><strong>What to request:</strong> Initial project identification and estimation</p>\n<p>Many firms will help define and estimate a project without up-front costs in exchange for an opportunity to be your builder. However, you should never enter into a long-term contract before the project is defined.</p>\n<h2>Lenders</h2>\n<p><strong>What to request:</strong> Underwriting standards and requirements</p>\n<p>Your initial call should help you understand a lender’s underwriting standards as well as identify the documentation you’ll need to provide to determine initial loan qualification. Keep in mind, a good lender will not simply talk about how much you can borrow, but rather, how much you should borrow. Most lenders expect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Financials</strong> – Three years of financial statements plus a current year-to-date financial statement</li>\n<li><strong>Appraisal </strong>or<strong> Broker’s Opinion of Value</strong> – Current market value of your property</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to these three areas of support, you may also want to talk to a <strong>church construction consultant</strong>. Experienced in helping ministries define project scopes, stay on budget, and avoid pitfalls, a church construction consultant can even save you tens of thousands of dollars.

How might ministry be affected?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, most churches do not fully consider these questions until they experience the untimely death of a leader. <!--more--> For them, recovery can be difficult and long. Although it can never bring back a beloved minister, being prepared ahead of time with key man insurance can greatly assist a church's recovery from a financial standpoint.</p>\n<p>Simply put, key man insurance is life insurance placed on the pastor or other key leader and owned by the church. Its purpose is to compensate for financial losses the church may face upon the death of that leader.</p>\n<h2>Key man insurance financially supports a church in four important ways:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>It gives time to conduct a proper search for the leader's successor.</li>\n<li>It offsets any decline in giving.</li>\n<li>If the church is mortgaged during this transition period, the policy shows financial strength to the lender. </li>\n<li>Lenders are more likely to renew a loan when a collateral assignment is in place on a key man policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How Much Key Man Coverage Do We Need?</h2>\n<p>Consider the following two areas when applying for key man insurance:</p>\n<h3><strong>Debt</strong></h3>\n<p>At maximum, insurance companies will insure up to 70% of your total debt. For example, a church with $1 million in loans should aim for $700,000 in debt coverage. Depending on a church's overall debt load, some lenders may require a portion of the key man insurance benefit to be assigned to them.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ministry Operations</strong></h3>\n<p>It can take up to four years to financially recover from the loss of a dynamic pastor. It is usually the second and third year after a pastor's death before a church begins to feel the full effect of the loss. For that reason, it is recommended to obtain coverage based on the church's current annual income. At maximum, an insurance company will cover 70%. For example, if your income is $1 million, aim for $700,000 in coverage. This is in addition to the debt coverage amount. </p>\n<p><span>Using the example amounts, the church would need a </span><strong>total of $1.4 million in key man coverage</strong><span>.</span> </p>\n<h2>Consider Personal Life Insurance As an Added Benefit</h2>\n<p>A church may purchase a separate life insurance policy for the pastor in addition to key man insurance. This benefits the pastor's family by allowing the pastor to own the policy and name the beneficiaries. It also makes the policy portable. It should be separate from the key man policy and the church should 1099 or W-2 the pastor for the premium. This alleviates the possible taxation of the death benefit to the beneficiary.</p>\n<h2>How Much Personal Life Insurance Should a Pastor Have?</h2>\n<p>At minimum, it is recommended that a pastor obtain 5-10 times his or her annual salary, plus 70% of personal debt. Also, consideration can be given for the number and ages of children as well as spousal income. </p>\n</p>\n<p>For more information about key man insurance for your ministry, call 866.621.1787 or <a title=\"click here to request a free quote\" href=\"/insurance/request-a-quote/\">click here to request a free quote</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

The following tips will help you maximize your benefits by the April 15 deadline.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/25853/file-2608042670-png/Last-Minute-Tax-Tips.png\" alt=\"Last-Minute-Tax-Tips\" /></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>For Your 2014 Return:</h2>\n<p><strong>Contribute to an IRA.</strong></p>\n<p>Every penny you put in an <a href=\"/investments/ira/\">IRA</a> can lower your taxable income, which may lower your tax bill.* Assuming you have earned income, those under age 50 can contribute up to $5,500 to their own IRA and/or $5,500 to a spouse’s IRA. If you are 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $1,000. It must be contributed before April 15, 2015 (tax day).</p>\n<p>If you expect to have minimal tax liability this year, consider funding a Roth IRA. Contributions are taxed in the current year, but qualified distributions*, including investment gains, may not be taxed.</p>\n<p><strong>Take advantage of the Saver’s Credit</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you contribute to a retirement account, your adjusted gross income is no more than $30,000 (single) or $60,000 (married filing jointly) in 2014, and you meet other qualifications, you may be eligible for the Saver’s Credit—up to $1,000 (single) or $2,000 (married filing jointly). This is an actual reduction in your tax bill, not a deduction, which simply lowers your taxable income.</p>\n<h2>For Your 2015 Return:<strong> </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Adjust your withholdings.</strong></p>\n<p>If you will owe a big tax bill or receive a large tax refund for 2014, consider adjusting your employer’s income tax withholding. The goal is to withhold enough throughout the year to avoid a large tax refund. This is counterintuitive for people who enjoy refunds; however, a refund means you’ve given Uncle Sam a zero-interest loan when you could have been saving or investing that extra withholding.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Increase charitable giving. </strong></p>\n<p>Giving allows you to recognize your money as God’s faithful provision. It can also potentially lower your tax bill if your itemized deductions are greater than the standard deduction. Start by tithing. Then consider a planned giving vehicle such as a <a href=\"/planned-giving/faq\">Donor Advised Fund</a>. This allows for upfront tax deductions from cash and non-cash gifts, plus automatic tracking of giving.</p>\n<p><strong>Lower your taxable income.</strong></p>\n<p>Contributing to traditional IRAs and employer plans like a <a href=\"/retirement-planning/403b/\">403(b)</a> or 401(k) is a great way to lower your taxable income. Invest as much as you can and increase your contributions at least annually until you can invest the maximum amount. Once you reach the maximum for your employer plan, you may be able to contribute up to $5,500 into an IRA each year for you and/or your spouse.*</p>\n<p><strong>Talk to a tax advisor.</strong></p>\n<p>Taxes can be complicated and tedious. Work with a tax advisor to establish a plan of action. The right professional may save you much more than the cost of their services.</p>\n<p><strong>Continue educating yourself. </strong></p>\n<p>Take time to research financial topics for yourself (kudos for reading this article!).

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>A notice issued by the IRS this month provides much-needed \"transitional relief\" from the $100 per day, per employee, penalty mandated by the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) for <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Affordable-Care-Act/Employer-Health-Care-Arrangements\">employer healthcare arrangements</a>. Watch as church law and tax expert Richard Hammar explains how this important development affects your church.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<div><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/yunfu7FNwkk\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\" data-service=\"youtube\"></iframe></div>\n</p>\n<h2>Key Points:</h2>\n<p>1. Employer payment plans whereby a church pays for or reimburses employee health insurance premiums trigger a significant penalty of $100 per day per affected employee. That’s <strong>$36,500</strong> per year per employee. This penalty applies to any employer payment plan adopted since January 1, 2014.</p>\n<p>2. Employers with fewer than 50 employees since January 1, 2014 are eligible for transitional relief. They will not be assessed the $100 per day penalty for 2014 and the first half lf 2015. However, the penalty will be imposed thereafter, so you should discontinue any existing employer payment plan and consider other means of providing health coverage for your employees. One way that was approved by the IRS in Notice 2015-17 is to implement a plan that increases an employee’s compensation, but does not condition the payment of the additional compensation on the purchase of health coverage.</p>\n<p>3. “Large employers” with 50 or more full-time employees should terminate their employer payment plan immediately since they are not eligible for transitional relief from the $100 per day per employee penalty. It is imperative that these employers consult with a tax professional to minimize or avoid the risk of triggering the penalty.</p>\n<p>4. In the past, some employers thought that they could avoid the $100 per day penalty by treating their payment or reimbursement of employee health insurance as a taxable fringe benefit reported on Forms W-2 and 941. Employees of churches that followed this practice in 2014 should discuss with a tax professional the possibility of claiming a tax refund. The reasoning is that employer payment plans technically remain a nontaxable fringe benefit. This tax treatment was not changed by the Affordable Care Act. But few, if any, employers will continue providing this benefit to employees because it will trigger the $100 per day penalty. Employers with fewer than 50 employees are eligible for transitional relief from this penalty for 2014 and the first half of 2015. This means that employees whose W-2 reported the amount of their employer’s payment or reimbursement of personal health insurance may be entitled to a refund. Check with your tax professional for further details.</p>\n<p>5. The $100 per day penalty applies to all employers, including but not limited to churches. Employer payment plans have been popular not just among churches, but also among many small for-profit employers. As a result, as more employers become aware of this penalty, it is likely that Congress will be under mounting pressure to provide permanent relief. </p>\n<p>To stay up to date on future developments regarding important tax issues that affect your church, subscribe to this blog. </p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>The following guide is provided to help you protect your people and ministry from winter hazards. Some recommendations may apply only in northern climates, others are universal.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Slips and falls</h2>\n<p>This is the most frequent cause of liability insurance claims for churches in the winter. The question in these cases is whether the church acted in a reasonable manner to mitigate risk. If you fail to take preventative steps and there is an injury, your church could be found negligent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inside, use non-slip rugs and mop up puddles immediately.</li>\n<li>Set out cones or warning signs to mark wet spots.</li>\n<li>Use ice-melt on sidewalks and parking lots, before and during services as needed.</li>\n<li>Even if the church is not found liable for the incident, be aware that your current policy will pay up to your medical payment’s limit for any injuries. These can increase premiums over time. For this reason, consider limiting medical coverage for injuries to $5,000 per incident.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Snow/ice removal from parking lots</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Hire a snow removal contractor for your parking lot.</li>\n<li>Have the contractor provide a certificate of insurance for general liability, auto liability, and workers' compensation liability.</li>\n<li>Ask the contractor to prioritize your church by having them clear the parking lot once the snowfall hits a certain number of inches, especially before services.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Removal of snow/ice by custodial staff</h2>\n<p>The combination of artery-constricting temperatures and the physical exertion of shoveling snow is a recipe for a heart attack. To keep custodians safe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Opt for snow blowers.</li>\n<li>Require proper training and adherence to manufacturers' warnings.</li>\n<li>Have custodians work in pairs.</li>\n<li>Disperse ice-melt/sand as snow is cleared.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Assaults in parking lots</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Because the sun sets early in winter, ensure all parking lots are well lit.</li>\n<li>Designate individuals to escort people to their cars upon request.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Minors sledding/ice skating in parking lot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Put up warning signs prohibiting the activity.</li>\n<li>Stay aware of such activity to be able to stop it as needed. If someone gets hurt, the church can be held responsible for injuries on its premises.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Freezing pipes</h2>\n<p>Dollar for dollar, the largest claim cost during the winter for churches is from frozen pipes that burst.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep the heat on, even if it is only set to 50 or 55 degrees.</li>\n<li>Unhook hoses from outside faucets.</li>\n<li>Insulate all exterior-wall pipes and the building itself.</li>\n<li>Let water drip from pipes in areas vulnerable to freezing.</li>\n<li>While damage from a burst pipe will be covered by insurance, the cost to repair the pipe itself most likely won’t be covered. Make sure you have enough cash reserves for such expenses.</li>\n<li>Check your building more frequently during cold weather because water damage over time can be substantial.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Space heaters</h2>\n<p>Church employees commonly use space heaters in offices, but they can present a fire hazard.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider disallowing them altogether.</li>\n<li>Adhere to manufacturers’ warnings carefully to minimize potential liability.</li>\n<li>Ensure proper electrical regulatory systems are in place to be able to safely accommodate space heaters.</li>\n<li>Do not allow space heaters around other flammable items such as trash baskets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Weather monitoring</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assign someone to keep tabs on the weather, including during services, using <a href=\"http://www.noaa.gov/wx.html\">NOAA’s National Weather Service</a>, in order to be able to respond to changing conditions quickly.</li>\n<li>Have a policy for communicating worsening weather conditions to people both before and during services.</li>\n<li>Utilize the church website and social media channels as well as email and local radio and television stations to communicate proactively.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Snow accumulation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To prevent roof damage or collapse, hire a contractor to remove accumulated snow. Do not use church custodians or volunteers.</li>\n<li>Have the contractor provide a certificate of insurance for general liability and workers’ compensation insurance.</li>\n<li>Clean gutters and inspect drains routinely.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Colds and flu</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To prevent the spread of infection among young children, have a communicable disease policy and distribute it to parents. For example, some churches ask that a child be kept with a parent rather than in the nursery/children’s area if they’ve had a fever within the last 24 hours.</li>\n<li>Provide hand sanitizer for children’s areas, restrooms, kitchens, and even the foyer.</li>\n<li>Ensure proper cleaning/sanitation measures are maintained throughout the church, especially in children’s areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Vehicles</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Thoroughly inspect church-owned vehicles prior to winter and perform all necessary maintenance.</li>\n<li>Implement a policy banning all hand-held cell phone use while operating any church vehicle. Even pastoral staff members and other church employees driving their personal vehicles on church business should refrain because liability can easily roll up to the church in the event of an accident.</li>\n<li>While driving at night, be aware of the risk of hitting a deer. Anyone driving church vehicles, especially with minors, should reduce speed and carefully watch for deer. According to the <a href=\"http://www.iii.org/article/avoiding-deer-car-collisions\">Insurance Information Institute</a>, if one darts in front of the vehicle, the best thing to do, though counterintuitive, is to stay in your lane. Apply the brakes, but do not swerve.</li>\n<li>Keep an emergency winter kit in all church vehicles containing matches, a flashlight with fresh batteries, snacks, a snow shovel, sand, tow chains, battery cables, a windshield scraper, and a blanket.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information about church risk management and insurance, call 866.621.1787 or email <a href=\"mailto:info@agfinancialinsurance.com\">info@agfinancialinsurance.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Most church leaders are all too familiar with the fact that giving can fluctuate dramatically month to month. Because of this fluctuation, it’s important to maintain a certain level of liquidity, which is different for every church based on their needs. Liquidity is basically the amount of cash that can be obtained at any given time. With adequate liquidity, ministries can have the financial flexibility to cover unforeseen expenses, especially during lower giving times. Without a cash reserve to draw from, many churches have found themselves scrambling to raise funds when needs come up. This can overburden a congregation, causing regular tithes and missions offerings to suffer. Alternatively, a church may have to take on more debt than would be wise.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>A healthy cash reserve protects against:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>unexpected expenses</li>\n<li>declines in giving</li>\n<li>building maintenance and repair costs</li>\n<li>periods of transition</li>\n</ul>\n<p>so you can better plan for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>new ministry initiatives</li>\n<li>large purchases</li>\n<li>building renovations and expansion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But first, you have to figure out the right liquidity level for your ministry’s needs. To do that, consider three areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Historic cash flow fluctuations</li>\n<li>Past unplanned expenses</li>\n<li>Anticipated future opportunities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Together these can help determine your target liquidity — the amount you should maintain in cash reserves.</p>\n<h2>How to reach your target liquidity</h2>\n<p><strong>Build saving into the budget.</strong></p>\n<p>As a best practice, your annual church budget should provide for a positive cash flow (more money coming in than going out). Subtract total expenses from total revenue to ensure you have some money to set aside. Use these funds to build your cash reserves.</p>\n<p>As a guideline, aim to designate 10% of the church budget towards building up your cash reserves. This may require reworking the budget to reduce expenses. If you can’t do 10% right away, aim for 5% and build up.</p>\n<p>First, the money should be set aside to build up three to six months of operative costs. Then, when the HVAC system breaks down or the carpet wears out, you’ll be able to absorb the expense without having to go into debt.</p>\n<p>After you’ve built up three to six months of operating costs, continue taking advantage of the positive cash flow created by your budget to save for future church goals and be able to respond to ministry opportunities.</p>\n<p>To help you get started, use the church budget template in the <em><a title=\"Interactive Guide to Church Finance\" href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/church-finance-ebook/\">Interactive Guide to Church Finance</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Although building cash reserves into the church budget is the best long-term solution, if you’re needing cash quickly, you may have to get creative. One pastor, new to the church, noticed it didn’t have an emergency fund. In the past, it had struggled to raise money for needs as they came up. To jumpstart their cash reserve, he decided to sell unused assets the church owned, including furniture, old audio and video equipment, choir robes, and tools. He also invited people to donate unwanted items for the sale. In this way, the church raised over $10,000.</p>\n<p><strong>Grow your savings through short-term investments.</strong></p>\n<p>Once you have some cash built up, consider growing it through short-term investments. One effective strategy is laddering. Laddering simply means staggering the investments so they mature at different times. This lets you take advantage of higher interest rates while still having regular access to funds.</p>\n<p>For example, rather than investing $75,000 for a one-year period and renewing each year, create a three-year ladder by putting $25,000 in a one-year investment, $25,000 in a two-year investment, and $25,000 in a three-year investment.</p>\n<p>After the first year, take the maturing one-year investment and place it in a new three-year investment. After the second year, the initial two-year investment matures. Put that into a new three-year investment. After the third year, the initial three-year investment matures. Place it in a new three-year investment.</p>\n<p>Starting in year four, all of your investments will be earning the higher three-year rate. And you will have access to a third of your principle as it matures each year.</p>\n<p>To see how a laddering strategy can help build your cash reserve, watch this short video:</p>\n<div ><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/h6dQaZq8X5k?list=PLS35Et-nHKCyl_94XMi9PW2qp7hWbptkG\" width=\"639\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>For more information about how churches can invest, call 866.621.1787 or email <a title=\"investments@agfinancial.org\" href=\"mailto: investments@agfinancial.org\">investments@agfinancial.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>What do a Baptist, a non-denominational, and an AG pastor have in common? When these three are joined by a lawyer and a certified church risk manager, the answer is a passion for educating fellow ministers and churches about church risk management best practices.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Recently, Risk Management LIVE took on a new format where expertise and experience came together for an engaging discussion about common church litigation issues and best practices. The guest panel joining Rich Hammar and Jerry Sparks included Gary Hay, lead pastor of Hope Community Church, Tom Demers, executive pastor at High Street Baptist, and Carter McDaniel, business administrator at Central Assembly of God.</p>\n<p>Out of this unique session came several key points and recommendations:</p>\n<h2>Sexual misconduct with minors</h2>\n<p>This remains the number one reason that churches end up in court. To reduce the risk of an incident in your church, make sure you properly screen all workers using this 6-step process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Written application</li>\n<li>Interview</li>\n<li>Background check</li>\n<li>Reference checks, preferably from institutions rather than individuals </li>\n<li>Two-adult policy</li>\n<li>Six-month rule</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Parental consent forms vs. liability waivers</h2>\n<p>For children’s activities, churches may have parents sign liability waivers. This is ethically questionable because waivers are an attempt by the church to relieve itself of liability for its own negligence for incidents or tragedies that could have been prevented. </p>\n<p>In addition, waivers have limited legal value and may not protect the church from all liability in the event of a lawsuit. This is because a parent cannot legally waive liability on behalf of a child. They can only release the church from liability for their own personal damages, not the child’s. </p>\n<p>It’s preferable and recommended to use parental consent forms, which should provide the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Signed permission for a child to participate in specific activities (or a declination of permission)</li>\n<li>A list of the child’s medical conditions, including allergies</li>\n<li>A named individual(s) who can make emergency medical decisions if the parents cannot be reached</li>\n<li>Parents’ contact information</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Security and check-in systems</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest security sticking points for churches has to do with the process and policies in place for dropping off and picking up young children. The panel agreed that <strong>electronic check-in systems </strong>are helpful for ensuring each child is returned to the right adult. These systems may use biometric scanning, fobs, or coded stickers. For example, Central Assembly’s system requires parents to enter a phone number where they can be reached during service. The program then prints out an identification sticker to be placed on the child’s back, as well as a separate sticker with a unique security code matching the child's sticker. If, for any reason, the parent cannot present the sticker when picking up their child, the church follows a defined security protocol to verify who checked the child in and whether or not the child can be given to that individual. This is largely to help prevent children from being mistakenly given to non-custodial parents.</p>\n<p>In addition to electronic check-in systems, <strong>security cameras</strong> posted in strategic spots throughout the church provide an essential and affordable security component. It’s recommended to place them in nursery and preschool rooms, as well as public areas of the church, such as the foyer. Establish a policy for the amount of time the church will keep footage. In general, it is a good risk management practice to align your church with the policies and procedures of local public schools because they are held to state standards. If the local school has no policy for keeping video footage, benchmark your procedures with other churches and nonprofit organizations in your area.</p>\n<p>In addition to these topics, the panel also covered concealed carry weapons and how to protect your church in an armed shooter situation. <a title=\"Watch the full session here.\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67cqtqRafUI&amp;list=PLS35Et-nHKCyBb23R2pHbuDu-YmGETdQT\">Watch the full session here.</a> </p>\n<p>To learn more about how your church can manage risk, tune into <a title=\"Risk Management LIVE\" href=\"/insurance/risk-management/riskmgmtlive/\">Risk Management LIVE</a> every month or call <strong>866.662.8210</strong>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Summer fun can quickly turn tragic without proper planning. Here's how to keep two favorites—camping and swimming—safe for kids and your church, plus a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nz-KsgHNxk&amp;list=PLS35Et-nHKCyBb23R2pHbuDu-YmGETdQT&amp;index=3\">video discussion</a> and helpful links.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Camping</p>\n</h2>\n<h3>Worker screening</h3>\n<p>Screen all adults who will be working with minors by obtaining both background checks and references. You also need to have a careful selection process for minors who will be working with younger kids. </p>\n<p>If you allow outside groups or other churches to use your camp facilities and provide their own workers, you will need to obtain a signed affidavit from the church or group stating that it has completed a background check, including a National Criminal Search and a National Sex Offender Search, and verified the references for each participant confirming their suitability to work with and around minors. The undersigned further warrants that they are aware of no information that would suggest any of the participants pose a risk of harm to minors. </p>\n<h3>Parental consent</h3>\n<p>For each camper, obtain a completed and signed <strong>Activity Participation Agreement </strong>and<strong> Parental Permission and Medical Consent </strong>form (see Helpful Tools below). These documents allow parents to consent to or decline permission for their child to participate in any given camp activity. They also include emergency contact information, a medical release to seek emergency care if needed, health insurance information, and a list of the child’s medications and allergies. </p>\n<p>Many churches don’t realize it is illegal for a registered nurse to distribute medication without written consent from a doctor. Prior to camp, be sure to obtain both the parents' and doctor’s permission for medication to be administered to a child at camp. </p>\n<p>In addition to the Activity Participation Agreement, parents also need to complete a <strong>Photo/Video Release Form</strong> for photos or videos taken of their child during camp. Churches may expose themselves to liability if they use or post photos and videos of minors without parental consent.</p>\n<h3>Emergencies</h3>\n<p>Prepare an emergency response plan with action steps to follow in case of a missing camper, a fire, or severe weather. Also outline any medical procedures to be followed, such as CPR. Although I recommend that all adult camp supervisors be CPR certified, you should at least have one or two certified individuals available to help in an emergency. In addition, if a camper is injured, ensure that a detailed accident report is completed to provide an accurate record of the incident.</p>\n<h3>General safety</h3>\n<p>Provide clear rules for camper conduct and inform parents of those rules as well as procedures for dealing with misconduct.</p>\n<p>All vehicles, including four-wheelers and golf carts, should be operated by licensed drivers only.</p>\n<p>Install working smoke alarms and fire extinguishers in each dorm and meeting room. Inspect them routinely.</p>\n<p>Check your insurance policy to make sure inflatables are covered, and always follow all manufacturers’ recommendations for their use. If you do not, and there is an injury, your church could be found liable for negligence.</p>\n<p>Recommended staff/child camp ratios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>6 to 8 years old—one adult for every 6 campers</li>\n<li>9 to 14 years old—one adult for every 8 campers</li>\n<li>15 to 18 years old—one adult for every 10 campers</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Swimming</p>\n</h2>\n<h3>Pools</h3>\n<p>Whenever possible, it’s best to utilize a municipal swimming pool rather than a pool owned by the church or an individual because in doing so, you transfer risk from your church to the municipality that operates the pool. The municipality provides trained staff and lifeguards who carry the legal responsibility for supervision. However, you will still need to have parents sign a consent form for each child prior to the activity.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if your church uses its own pool, here are some ways to help reduce risk:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The pool should be fenced. Safety covers and pool alarms can add additional layers of protection.</li>\n<li>Make sure chemicals are not overused. Ingestion of pool chemicals and skin reactions are leading injuries.</li>\n<li>Have trained lifeguards supervising at all times and p<span>ost the pool rules clearly.</span></li>\n<li>Have pool markers indicating water depth.</li>\n<li>Have “No Diving” markers near shallow depths.</li>\n<li>Prohibit head-first entry in shallow depths and enforce the rule.</li>\n<li>Warn against prolonged breath holding, which can lead to shallow-water blackout, a lesser-known but very deadly form of drowning.</li>\n<li>Require all swimmers to take a swim test prior to water activities.</li>\n<li>Require a bracelet to be worn by each swimmer that indicates their level of swimming proficiency: green for those who can swim anywhere, yellow for those who must stay in shallow water, and red for those not allowed in the pool. Bracelets should be non-removable except by scissors. If you are a Church Mutual Insurance customer, you can <a title=\"order these bracelets\" href=\"https://www.churchmutual.com/112/Safety-Resources-for-Camps-and-Conference-Centers\">order these bracelets</a> for your church free of charge.</li>\n<li>Require non-swimmers to wear life jackets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lakes</h3>\n<p>As with swimming pools, lakes at church camps should have clearly posted rules. Be sure to include rules that prohibit swimming at night and require life jackets to be worn during all lake activities, including swimming and using canoes or paddle boats.</p>\n<p>Although kids love water blobs and trampolines, my personal preference is for church camps to avoid them altogether. However, if you are going to use them, be sure to follow the manufacturer’s rules with NO exceptions. Put someone in charge of reviewing and implementing the rules before use to ensure compliance.<span> </span></p>\n<h2><span>Richard Hammar &amp; Jerry Sparks Discuss Summer Risks</span></h2>\n</p>\n<div><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/6Nz-KsgHNxk\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\" data-service=\"youtube\"></iframe></div>\n</p>\n<h2>Helpful Tools</h2>\n<p><strong><a title=\"Staff &amp; Volunteer Resource Kit\" href=\"http://bit.ly/1S0TSzn\">Staff &amp; Volunteer Resource Kit</a> </strong></p>\n<p>Includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Activity Participation Agreement</li>\n<li>Personal Reference Check Form</li>\n<li>Employment Application Form</li>\n<li>Volunteer Application Form</li>\n<li>Driver Release Form</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For information about how you can reduce church risk overall, call <strong>866.662.8210</strong> or email me at <a href=\"mailto:jsparks@agfinancial.org\">jsparks@agfinancial.org</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>What steps will you take to stay safe this summer? </strong>Leave your questions and comments below.</p>\n<p><em>This article does not constitute legal advice and is not a substitute for obtaining professional legal counsel.</em></p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>October 19-25 is <strong>National Save for Retirement Week</strong>. Consider this your official reminder to make retirement saving a priority starting this week. To help you do that, here are 10 simple ideas.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3 >1. Set up automatic retirement account deposits.</h3>\n<p>Even $15 or $20 a month is much better than nothing, especially if your employer matches your contributions. Reevaluate the amount you can save every few months with the goal of increasing it little by little.</p>\n<h3 >2. Determine to deposit money gifts received throughout the year into your retirement account.</h3>\n<p>Consider these to be gifts you’re just waiting until retirement to open.</p>\n<h3 >3. Have a cash-back credit card? Don’t spend the earnings.</h3>\n<p>Invest them into your retirement account instead.</p>\n<h3 >4. Trade your next vending machine treat for a more secure future.</h3>\n<p>Two treats a week, at about $1.50, adds up to an extra $78 a year that you can invest for retirement.</p>\n<h3 >5. Consider refinancing your mortgage and allocating the money you save for retirement.</h3>\n<p>To estimate how much you could save, do a quick online search for “refinance calculator” and enter in the details of your current versus future interest rate. The calculator will show you how much you could possibly save, as well as how many months it will take for you to cover the bank fees with those savings. For example, on a $200,000 home owned for 5 years at an 8% rate, a refinance to 3% would result in over $600 in monthly savings ($7,200 each year). Even if your closing costs were $3,000, you’d break even in just five months.</p>\n<h3 >6. Round up your checkbook.</h3>\n<p>When you make a purchase, round up the payment to the next dollar. A $7.30 payment would round to $8.00 in your checkbook, creating an invisible savings account. At the end of the month, take the unanticipated extra and move it to your savings account.</p>\n<h3 >7. Begin tracking your spending this week by keeping all receipts.</h3>\n<p>At the end of the month, look back to see where your money went and how you might cut back, freeing up a few dollars for retirement saving.</p>\n<h3 >8. Adjust your W-4.</h3>\n<p>Getting a tax refund at the end of the year may seem like a bonus, but it can also tempt you to spend it all at once. Either put the refund towards retirement or adjust withholdings to increase your take-home pay. Just make sure to put those extra funds into your retirement account.</p>\n<h3 >9. Challenge yourself to forego eating out for a month.</h3>\n<p>Instead, plan all meals based on store specials in your area and what you currently have on hand. To help you stick to the plan, cook extra portions and freeze them for lunches at work or busy nights when you don’t have much time to cook. At the end of the month, put the extra money saved toward retirement.</p>\n<h3 >10. If you tend to use cash, designate a retirement coin jar.</h3>\n<p>Adopt a “spend no coins rule” and drop all extra change into your jar. At the end of the month, count it up and deposit that amount into your retirement account. If you have children, let them help you sort and count the coins. This is an easy way to start teaching them the importance of saving.</p>\n<p>For additional ways to save, download the free eBook below.</p>\n<p>For more information on retirement strategies and to <a title=\"open an IRA\" href=\"/retirement-planning/403b/\" rel=\"noopener\">open an IRA</a> or <a title=\"403(b)\" href=\"/retirement-planning/403b/\" rel=\"noopener\">403(b)</a>, contact our team at <strong>866.621.1787</strong> or by emailing <a title=\"retirement@agfinancial.org\" href=\"mailto: retirement@agfinancial.org\" rel=\"noopener\">retirement@agfinancial.org</a>.</p>\n<h3 >What will you do this week to boost your retirement savings?</h3>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p><em>\"Earn all you can, save all you can, give all you can.\" - John Wesley, Methodist theologian (1703-1791)</em></p>\n<p>The purpose of a budget is simple: to help you save money for future goals by limiting and tracking what you spend. <!--more-->The process, on the other hand, can feel complex. Some budgets have dozens of line items. If this works for you, keep doing it.</p>\n<p>If, however, such a detailed approach feels more like a burden than a help, don’t abandon budgeting. Simplify it, John Wesley-style. Grouping expenses into the following buckets can help make your budget—and maybe even life—a little simpler:</p>\n<h2>Giving</h2>\n<p>If you prefer spontaneous giving, budgeting for charitable gifts might feel restrictive. However, if giving is important to you, it deserves a spot in the budget. It may be helpful to think of this bucket as a reminder to prioritize your giving in keeping with other financial priorities.</p>\n<h2>Saving</h2>\n<p>Unlike the other buckets listed here, this one is for you. If you haven't already, start by creating an emergency fund to cover insurance deductibles, out-of-pocket health or dental expenses, and home and car maintenance. At minimum, build up three to six months of income in a savings account you can access easily.</p>\n<p>Next, create a retirement fund. People are living longer, yet many Americans have woefully little saved for retirement. No matter your age, the first savings you have after building an emergency fund should go toward retirement.</p>\n<p>Finally, create an opportunity fund. Maybe you’d like to purchase a rental home, complete a home renovation, or take a short-term missions trip. This fund is the key.</p>\n<h2>Debt</h2>\n<p>Into this bucket you can place all credit card balances, student loans, car loans, and your mortgage. In general, while your savings bucket should be growing, your debt bucket should be shrinking, as you pay down loans. In order to accomplish this, it’s crucial to make reducing and eliminating debt—especially high-interest credit card debt—a priority.</p>\n<h2>Yearly Expenses</h2>\n<p>These may include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Property taxes</li>\n<li>Car registration</li>\n<li>Homeowners’ association dues</li>\n<li>Home Maintenance</li>\n<li>Family vacations</li>\n<li>Holiday and birthday gifts</li>\n<li>Pet vaccinations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Add up the expenses, cushion it a bit, and then divide the total by 12 to get a monthly number you should be targeting. By setting aside money for these expenses throughout the year, it will be available when you need it.</p>\n<h2>Monthly Expenses</h2>\n<p>Into this bucket can go all ongoing expenses paid monthly, such as utilities and personal expenses. It’s helpful to look back at previous months’ expenses to accurately project the amount to allocate going forward.</p>\n<h2>Weekly Expenses</h2>\n<p>As the saying goes, “a small leak will sink a great ship.” Consider your weekly expenses to be the little leaks in your bank account. As such, they deserve careful management. Gas, groceries, coffee—these expenses add up quickly and can be challenging to track. Some people have found online tracking tools helpful.</p>\n<h2>Insurance</h2>\n<p>While this could be included in your yearly or monthly categories, we feel it deserves its own bucket because insurance occupies a significant percentage of many budgets. Review all insurance plans—<a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/insurance/property-casualty/\">car, home</a>, <a title=\"life\" href=\"/insurance/life/\" rel=\"noopener\">life</a>, health—at least every couple of years to make sure you’re paying the lowest premiums possible for the coverage you need.</p>\n<p>As you plan your budget, keep the big picture in mind. Ultimately, as long as your budget helps you save money, you’re on the right track.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>When it comes to personal financial planning, you can make mistakes without even realizing it. Let’s take a look at seven of the most common ones and how you can avoid them for a better financial future.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>1. Playing victim to your debt</h2>\n<p>If you tell yourself, “I’m never going to get out of debt,” you paralyze yourself from ever reaching that goal. Getting out of debt is possible. You just have to take one small step at a time. One recommended approach is to tackle your smallest debt first, putting as much money as possible toward it each month until it's paid off. Then take the money you were putting toward that previous debt and apply it to the next biggest debt until it's paid off, and so on.</p>\n<h2>2. Lack of forward thinking</h2>\n<p>When you’re young, retirement seems blurry and far away so most people put off saving. The fact is, the earlier you start saving, the less money is required overall to build a healthy retirement nest egg than if you wait. This is due to the power of compound interest. For example, someone who begins saving at 45 will need to save much more in order to have enough in retirement than someone who begins saving at 25, simply because the interest won’t have as many years to compound.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/myfuture/\" rel=\"noopener\">Watch how compound interest can impact your future.</a></p>\n<h2>3. Outdated beneficiaries</h2>\n<p>One of the most important aspects of good personal finance is keeping your beneficiaries up to date. This is something that must be done throughout life. If you've recently experienced a major event such as a marriage, birth, death of a spouse or child, or have entered retirement, take time to review your beneficiaries and make any needed changes.</p>\n<h2>4. Underestimating cash reserves</h2>\n<p>It’s hard to overstate the importance of a healthy cash reserve to cushion against unexpected expenses, yet according to a recent <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/finance/consumer-index/financial-security-charts-0613.aspx\" rel=\"noopener\">survey by Bankrate</a> measuring how secure Americans feel about their finances, only 45% of people had saved enough to cover at least three months of expenses. Most had saved either nothing at all or less than recommended. Aim to put aside at least three to six months' worth of household expenses in an easy-access vehicle like an <a href=\"/investments/open-an-investment/\" rel=\"noopener\">AGFinancial Investment Certificate</a> or money market account. The primary purpose of these cash reserves should be to handle unexpected emergencies rather than to earn high rates of return.</p>\n<h2>5. No distribution strategy</h2>\n<p>You spend a lot of time developing a savings strategy for retirement, but it’s just as important to have a strategy for how your funds will be distributed to you once you actually retire. Distributions need to be planned carefully both for maximum tax benefit and to avoid the possibility of outliving your funds.</p>\n<h2>6. Lack of Social Security understanding</h2>\n<p>Beginning this year (2015), the IRS will again be mailing printed Social Security statements directly to you. It's crucial to review this statement and understand what it means so you can maximize this benefit as you age. Remember, each financial situation is different. Make sure you fully understand the possibility for penalties, taxation of your benefits, the benefits for your spouse, and the best time at which to begin receiving payments. A tax professional can help answer your questions.</p>\n<h2>7. Jumbled priorities</h2>\n<p>Many families have limited discretionary income, and one of the biggest mistakes is not properly prioritizing how that money will be used for maximum benefit. For example, it’s common to see parents save aggressively for their child’s college education at the expense of their own retirement. Make sure your discretionary income is serving your most important financial goals first, whether that is paying off debt, building cash reserves, or saving for retirement. These things have the greatest potential to negatively or positively affect your future well-being.</p>\n<p>With a little planning and intentionality, you can avoid these common mistakes and build a solid financial foundation to carry you into the future.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>As you undertake a church facility expansion, be prepared for these 9 challenges.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>1. Zoning</h2>\n<p>When purchasing an existing building or land, confirm that churches are considered an allowable use on that property by checking with the responsible local governmental entity. If they are not, rezoning the property can take time and money with no guarantee of approval. You will also need to look at the zoning of your current facility if your expansion requires a building permit—zoning codes may have changed.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Watch Dr. Richard Hammar's advice on zoning for churches.\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgY_qel9IAg&amp;list=PLS35Et-nHKCxpKj9y6sX-vVIVyOAbCgMi\">Watch Dr. Richard Hammar's advice on zoning for churches.</a></p>\n<h2>2. Land Use Code</h2>\n<p>This extends beyond zoning to include requirements such as green space, landscaping, lot coverage ratios, square footage, height, setbacks, and many other issues. Consult a local civil engineer early in the planning process. They can assist with the initial feasibility of your project by defining the physical parameters for expansion.</p>\n<h2>3. Inspections</h2>\n<p>If you purchase an existing building or vacant property, obtain a fully detailed building inspection and code review. These will reveal the property's true condition, including the building and all its systems and components so you'll know exactly what you are buying. Additionally, a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment is recommended to determine if there are any environmental concerns.</p>\n<p>Not only will this information be helpful in negotiating a purchase price, but it's also critical for accurately projecting your project budget. Walk the building with a contractor and code expert to get an idea of the cost of code compliance.</p>\n<h2>4. Building Code</h2>\n<p>Building codes ensure the minimum level of structural and mechanical integrity during construction and remodeling. Occupancy codes are part of this and can be of particular concern when renovating an existing building into a church. We have seen car dealerships, big-box stores, theaters, warehouses, and many other buildings renovated for use by churches, but this is not always simple or inexpensive.</p>\n<h2>5. Cost</h2>\n<p>Do not use assumed cost-per-square-foot numbers. Talk with local builders who can provide current construction costs. Although it is difficult to get an exact cost before a project is fully designed, a qualified contractor can give you an accurate range, which can be refined as the design is developed. Keep in mind, construction isn't the only cost. Be sure to allow for chairs, a sound system, lighting, and other items. In addition, your operating budget may be impacted after the project, due to increased utilities, maintenance, or staffing.</p>\n<h2>6. Design</h2>\n<p>Most successful church projects are a result of some form of <a title=\"design-build\" href=\"/help/#glossary\">design-build</a> process, whether the architect and builder are one entity or are separate entities coordinating their efforts. Most architects, whether they specialize in church design or not, can design your project. The question is, do you truly need design work? Many churches initially just need help with space planning and programming in order to better define the project—a service most builders offer.</p>\n<p><img id=\"img-1404421182900\" src=\"//cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/25853/file-1156853734-png/images/hurdle-man[1].png\" alt=\"church construction\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>7. Contracts</h2>\n<p>The first consultant we typically recommend a church hire is a civil engineer. When it's time to begin programming and space planning, an architect or design-builder can help. However, do NOT enter into a long-term contract before your project is defined.</p>\n<p>Contract only for what you need. If you simply want help determining your priorities and figuring out what a project might look like, most architects and design-builders can assist you. Ask for a <strong>master planning</strong> or initial programming contract.</p>\n<p>As the project gets underway, be cautious of two types of contracts: 1) percentage-based design and 2) cost-plus construction without a not-to-exceed number. For design work, ask for a <strong>fixed-price</strong> contract, and for construction, ask for a <strong>guaranteed maximum price</strong> contract. This will prevent your church from having to pay for unanticipated cost overruns, except for items you choose to change. </p>\n<h2>8. Project Management</h2>\n<p>Beware of the tendency to underestimate the time, energy, focus, and resources a building project demands. Even if you are hiring a contractor, it is recommended that someone in your church or representing your church be appointed as the primary contact for project management and administration from the church's perspective.</p>\n<h2>9. Funding</h2>\n<p>Most church expansion projects are funded with a combination of at least two, if not all three of the following: funds on-hand, funds raised specifically for the project, and funds borrowed. Getting a handle on what you can afford while figuring out what you need to build and what it could cost is the right way to approach a building project. Buffer initial estimates with a contingency of 10-15%. As the design and pricing is refined, that contingency can be reduced. However, we recommend carrying a 5-10% contingency going into the project, even if you have a guaranteed maximum price contract.</p>\n<p>Keeping all these points in mind will better prepare you to face the inevitable hurdles of church expansion. But before you start, make sure you've given full thought to the following: Who are you as a church? What has God called you to do? What should your facilities look like in order to make that happen?

Church finance, on the other hand, may fall to the bottom or be left off entirely. Yet it plays a critical role. When you set your church up to be financially strong, you tangibly equip it to accomplish its intangible, God-given calling. Though each church's calling is unique, those that are financially sound have several things in common:</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2 >1. A Firm Foundation: They Follow Good Financial Practices</h2>\n<p>Healthy budgeting and accounting practices lay a foundation of financial stability for your church, allowing you to keep your focus on ministry. Budgeting is the process of utilizing your monetary resources to its greatest benefit. Without a budget that you follow, track, and review, it can be difficult to keep the lights on, much less achieve new goals. Good financial practices are core to ministry survival and help make it possible to fulfill what God's calling you to do.</p>\n<h2 >2. Built to Last: They Prepare for the Unexpected</h2>\n<p>Once you have put solid financial practices into place, consider ways to sustain your ministry long term through solid risk management practices and proper insurance protection. As a pastor, you have been entrusted with providing a safe place for people to learn, worship, and minister. You ministry's future depends on how well you plan for the worst before it can happen. If a fire destroys your building or a child is hurt by a volunteer, the financial consequences can be crippling. More than just helping you avoid an expensive lawsuit, risk management is an ongoing process of anticipating the unexpected so your ministry can continue to impact your community.</p>\n<h2 >3. Poised for the Future: They Plan Strategically for Growth</h2>\n<p>The two elements above provide the stable footing you need to be able to grow and widen your impact. But as your ministry budget grows, new financial challenges arise. Churches who reach a budget of $1 million or higher are bigger than many businesses. It's crucial to have internal programs and controls in place in order to be able to grow at a financially healthy pace that doesn't exhaust your resources and hurt your ministry in the long run. Churches who plan strategically for growth are ready for each new stage when it arrives.</p>\n<p>By following good financial practices, preparing for the unexpected, and planning strategically for growth, every church can experience financial success that supports a thriving ministry.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>A space shortage can be exciting because it’s often an indicator of growth. However, if not handled proactively, lack of space can inhibit further growth. Whether you’re short on worship or ministry space, these practical solutions will help you maximize it.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Maximize Worship Space</h2>\n<p>Generally, if an auditorium is at least 80% full according to code-determined seating capacity, it is full. At this point, further growth is unlikely. If you’ve reached this level and wish to maintain growth momentum, you have several options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chairs</strong> – Opting for chairs rather than pews allows you to fit more people into the same space. </li>\n<li><strong>Overflow space</strong> – If you have a large foyer or other room not in use during services, consider broadcasting a live video feed of the service in that area. Ask a core group of people to worship there on a rotating schedule to open up sanctuary seats for newcomers. </li>\n<li><strong>Another service</strong> – Although a great way to maximize your sanctuary, this can be a huge adjustment for staff and volunteers. </li>\n<li><strong>Larger venue for Sunday worship</strong> – We have worked with churches that have successfully relocated Sunday morning services to schools, movie theaters, community centers, and other unconventional locations.</li>\n<li><strong>Sanctuary expansion</strong> – Most sanctuaries are constructed in a way that would make this option difficult and expensive, but it may be viable for some.</li>\n<li><strong>New sanctuary</strong> – This is a major undertaking that should be considered in light of an overall facilities master plan.</li>\n<li><strong>Church plant</strong> – Pastor Rick Warren says a healthy mature church should do what a healthy mature adult does: have babies. Church plants that spring from existing churches are increasing.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-site strategy</strong> – A multi-site church strategy can be carried out in a variety of creative methods, often with the collateral benefit of helping solve space issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether you choose something temporary, like swapping pews for chairs, or the permanence of a new sanctuary, make sure the solution fits with your overall church vision.</p>\n<h2>Maximize Ministry Space</h2>\n<p>Ancillary ministry space should be approached differently than assembly space. Follow these three steps to get the most out of it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><h4>Take a Space Inventory</h4>\n<p>List every space you currently have and how it is being used, including the parking lot and all storage areas. Document square footage, features, and potential occupancy load. If possible, include a space plan or drawing.</li>\n<li>\n<p><h4>Assess Ministry Needs</h4>\n<p> Consider each ministry that uses space on campus. How many people are involved? What are their facility needs? Are they stagnate or growing? Would they grow if they had more space? Could they meet off-site? Also consider each ministry against the mission of the church. What has God called you to do? How are current facilities limiting that?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><h4>Develop a Facilities Use Plan</h4>\n<p>Now consider your ministry needs against your space inventory to see how to maximize the space. Often, the real issues are not what you thought. Part jigsaw puzzle, part balancing act, this step involves moving schedules and locations around to find the best solutions. Be creative about repurposing and renovating rooms as ministry needs change.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What are some of the space challenges your church has faced? What solutions did you implement?</strong> Share your ideas below.</p>\n<p>Every day we consult with ministries about their facility needs and offer solutions to resource their vision without jeopardizing current budgets.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Building from the ground up isn't your only option for church expansion. From car dealerships and movie theaters to grocery stores and fitness centers — buildings of all shapes and sizes are being repurposed as church facilities. As you determine the best strategy for your church, consider the following options and trends:</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Cost of Building vs. Buying</h2>\n<p>One of the results of a down economy and depressed real estate market is an increased supply of vacant commercial buildings available to purchase. The price of existing square footage has dropped over the last few years. Conversely, the cost of new construction has risen as fuel, materials, labor, and insurance rates have increased. As a result, it may be cheaper to buy and remodel than it would be to build new. This is particularly true when you are looking for a non-customized, multi-purpose, marketable building. However, it's important not to make assumptions. Calculate all the costs when evaluating your options.</p>\n<h2>Future Expansion Potential</h2>\n<p>AGFinancial recently financed the purchase and remodel of an 18-plex movie theater for <span>Calvary Church near Toledo, Ohio. They started by making alterations to some of the smaller theater rooms for nurseries, kids church, and classrooms. </span>Although a theater is not a good fit for every church, it was the perfect facility for this one because it offered plenty of restrooms, public connection space, a built-in café, an ample parking lot that is well lit, and several rooms that can be remodeled and finished as the church continues to grow. </p>\n<h2>Stewardship </h2>\n<p>Saddleback Church grew to thousands meeting in non-traditional buildings. Pastor Rick Warren once mentioned that part of the church's conviction early on was a desire to avoid investing millions of dollars into a worship space that would sit empty 6 days a week. <span>As you seek to be a good steward of your church facilities, factor in both current usage and future marketability of the space. A traditional church facility is often a single-purpose building that if/when outgrown, the market for that building is very limited, whereas a commercial or multi-purpose building may have a broader appeal.</span></p>\n<h2>Cool Factor</h2>\n<p>“Our church meets in _________.” Fill in the blank. There’s no doubt transforming a space to be used for the purpose of the Kingdom adds a new dimension to your facility. Pastor Matthew Barnett’s Dream Center in Los Angeles is housed in a former hospital built in the 1920’s. A church near Phoenix, Arizona, is currently remodeling a fitness center for its new facility. Repurposing can add character to your facility. </p>\n<h2>Design</h2>\n<p><span>Progressive styles that focus less on formality and more on durability are increasing in popularity. Stained concrete has replaced carpet. Utilitarian light fixtures have replaced more elaborate lighting features. Rather than implementing traditional church architecture, churches are seeking to create an inviting, coffee-shop feel that encourages personal relationships within the church</span>.</p>\n<h2>Green Churches</h2>\n<p><span>Some churches are choosing to focus on sustainability by building an eco-friendly or “green” facility, incorporating LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) principles into their building. Repurposing an existing facility is one eco-friendly approach. Another is to incorporate recycled or LEED certified materials into your construction project. If you are considering environmental factors as you plan your new facility, check with your local municipality to see if they offer incentives for a green facility</span>. </p>\n<h2>Multi-Site Strategies</h2>\n<p>Existing buildings are an excellent option for multi-site churches. They allow a church to relocate or expand as the congregation grows and needs more space. Some multi-site churches build new, but normally within a specified model and targeted geographic area. </p>\n<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Church expansion is an exciting journey. As you consider your building options, here is what I recommend:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be aware of local zoning and land use<strong> codes</strong> when purchasing property.</li>\n<li>Fulfill your due diligence with environmental and property<strong> inspections</strong> when purchasing land or existing buildings.</li>\n<li>Compare the<strong> cost</strong> of repurposing to building new.</li>\n<li>Discuss financing strategies with an experienced <strong>church lender </strong>when you <strong>first begin making plans</strong>. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have questions regarding your church's plans, feel free to email me at <a href=\"mailto:sfink@agfinancial.org\" title=\"sfink@agfinancial.org\">sfink@agfinancial.org</a> or call <strong>888.599.6015</strong> to speak with a member of our team.</p>\n<p>Did your church build new or repurpose an existing facility?

Entire families are coming to Christ!</p>\n<p>In hopes of helping other church leaders, Pastor Williams sat down for an interview with the AGFinancial team and construction specialist Shawn Fink to share what he learned about managing a building project.</p>\n<h2 >AGFS: Tell us about The House Modesto and how your renovation project began.</h2>\n<p><strong>Williams: </strong>Several years back we had a K-12 school. Unfortunately, we had to shut down the school in 2008 because it was costing too much to run, and the economy had begun its downturn. For several years after that, we ran the children’s ministry from that empty space, but it wasn’t conducive for children. We had a vision of a new building with arcade games, a café where mom could watch the kids play, a five-story play area, and, of course, the sanctuary where we would minister. The existing infrastructure is what ended up becoming our children’s building now. Our kid’s pastor had the idea to call it Kidspace. We knew we were going to have kids dragging their moms and dads into church. It’s been amazing to hear the stories of kids we’re now ministering to.</p>\n<h2 >AGFS: What did you learn about the logistics of managing a building project?</h2>\n<p><strong>Williams: </strong>When Shawn told me how much time this would take—50% of my time—all I could do was laugh. He advised me to consider getting someone who could manage the project. I needed someone who could take the project and run with it, but I knew no one was going to do that like me because I was the one with the vision for it. Looking back, I know it was part of God’s will for me to do it, but now I would say without question that if you are in an executive role and you’re going to take on a building project, I would do whatever I could to hire someone to devote their every waking moment to the project. It is a full-time job from about a month before the project begins until a couple months after the project closes.</p>\n<h2 >AGFS: How did you coordinate the players—architect, builder, lender?</h2>\n<p><strong>Williams: </strong>We started with an architect. The challenge was that there were things he just couldn’t see, sitting in an office several states away. When you actually get into the project, the plans don’t always work. Looking back, I would have definitely started with a design-build firm rather than an architect. It would have made a lot more sense. The architect isn’t in the project every day, whereas the builder has the advantage of seeing how things need to be changed. I’d rather have the builder work with the architect and tell him, 'This is why it won’t work.' I’d want the builder running the architect, not the other way around. Later, when we added the nursery and preschool, we did it as a design-build, and it was much easier.</p>\n<p>As far as the lender goes, you can have great relationships with local banks and we do, but when it comes to large projects, banks are leery, as you can imagine, with the downturn in the economy. So you have to convince someone who’s unconvinced. That’s why, for us, to start out with AGFinancial was just a given. You guys have always understood who we are. You get what we do.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2 >AGFS: What would you say to churches that want to work with specialized church contracting companies only? Was that important for you?</h2>\n<p><strong>Williams: </strong>I’d say it doesn’t even matter. To me, it’s about the vision. If you don’t have a clear, defined vision of what you want to do and you want someone else to come up with that vision, you’ll end up with someone else’s vision. You have to know, 'Why am I doing this?' That revelation is key.</p>\n<h2 >AGFS: How would you suggest a church choose the right contracting company?</h2>\n<p><strong>Williams: </strong>Check their references thoroughly and go look at the work they’ve actually done. You have to vet them, do your due diligence, and come to a sense with your board and staff that this is the right company. But even after you’ve done all that, you may have challenges.</p>\n<h2 >AGFS: How did you deal with unexpected change orders and delays during construction?</h2>\n<p><strong>Williams: </strong>Our builder stepped up to the plate when we had some difficult situations, and I appreciate that. Anybody that’s going to do something like this will have changes that occur. I thank God that Shawn advised us to set aside 10% for changes, as a contingency fund, because it’s normal for things to come up. If we hadn’t done that, we wouldn’t have been able to complete the project with the vision we had in mind. It would have been heartbreaking not to finish.</p>\n<h2 >AGFS: Do you have any tips for handling conflicts during the construction process?<strong> </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Williams: </strong>To me, the project manager’s role is key in dealing with the challenges. In our case, I was the project manager. But if you hire someone, they have to be a bulldog—able to lay down the law in no uncertain terms. They also have to be able to diffuse uncomfortable situations. After all, the ministry of reconciliation is seeing the divide and then becoming the bridge, which takes the power of the Holy Spirit. So what kind of person can deal with conflict constantly and come out ahead? They have to have wisdom and not jump into the fight. Subcontractors get upset, and challenges happen. The interpersonal challenges inside that work environment can get heated. The neat thing is that I was able to lead a lot of our subcontractors to the Lord, which was awesome. However, if I hadn’t held the line in many areas, we would have ended up with subpar work. To me, this project was like building a fine home, and they wanted to build it more like a commercial building. It was constant pushing. In the end though, they had a great respect for me and I for them. We worked through it.</p>\n<h2 >AGFS: Let’s talk about life after the project. Is there anything you wish you had planned differently?</h2>\n<p><strong>Williams: </strong>If I had known better, I would have considered the energy increase. We’ve had about a 30-40% increase in our energy consumption. Looking back, I would have considered bringing in solar energy. Around here, it’s very common. We just didn’t know. You might find five or six churches that have done something like this and ask, ‘How did your facility maintenance costs change? How did energy costs change?’ If we had been more careful, we would have literally doubled our facilities cost estimates.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2 >AGFS: What additional advice would you give other pastors and churches facing a building project?</h2>\n<p><strong>Williams: </strong>I imagine it’s not too unusual that someone like myself ends up managing the project. Then you have a guy like Shawn saying it’s going to take 50% of your time, and you’re saying, ‘How am I going to do this, God?’ <em>I feel like Shawn’s relationship as a construction specialist to me was not just a good idea—it became imperative. </em>We had a major concrete challenge where he was tremendously helpful. He really had understanding because of his experience commercially. Someone like him needs to be in the original meetings with the architect or contractor. Why? Unless you’re an experienced commercial contractor, there are things you’re not going to hear that they will hear, things you will not understand that they will understand. Those things could make the difference of hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>\n<p>In the end, I’m very thankful that I had a company to work with like AGFinancial. We knew what we wanted, and you guys helped us do that. You shared the vision with us. If I was going to choose a company now, looking back, there’s no one else I would have worked with. To see the kids in there now crying and weeping at the altar, giving their hearts to the Lord, to see them literally dragging their parents to church, and to see their parents getting saved and hear the testimonies from them—that’s what it’s all about.</p>\n<p><strong>Has your church gone through a building project? What lessons did you learn? </strong>We’d love to hear your story in the comments section below.</p>\n<p>If you would like to speak with a construction specialist, call <strong>888.599.6015 </strong>or email Shawn Fink at <a href=\"mailto:sfink@agfinancial.org\">sfink@agfinancial.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Obtaining properly prepared financial statements is an accounting best practice for all businesses, including churches and other non-profits. Unfortunately, many churches do not realize their significance.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Financial statements are reports reflecting the financial health of an organization. They are compiled from the daily tracking of funds coming in and going out. All organizations should follow generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), using an accrual basis to record income and expenses when they are earned and incurred. However, many churches use a cash basis—recording income and expenses when they are received and paid—or a combination of both approaches.</p>\n<p>A complete set of financial statements for a non-profit organization generally includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet)</strong>: assets, liabilities, and net assets (net worth) on a stated date showing the reader where the organization is financially and where it has been (what is owned vs. what is owed)</li>\n<li><strong>Statement of Activities (Income Statement)</strong>: income, including contributions and expenses over a period of time showing the reader what resources (income) were available to complete the organization's objectives and how the resources were used (expenses)</li>\n<li><strong>Statement of Cash Flows (Cash Flow Statement)</strong>: inflows and outflows of cash over a period of time coinciding with the Statement of Activities and Statement of Financial Position</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Financial statements benefit your church in three important areas:</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>1. Providing Assurance</h3>\n<p>Donors want to know where their money goes. Providing an accurate statement of accounting for donations not only gives the donor assurance that their contributions are being used prudently, but it also protects your church by demonstrating how and when funds have been used.</p>\n<h3>2. Budget Planning</h3>\n<p>As you project income and expenses for the new year, reviewing past financial statements can give you a good idea of what giving might look like going forward. By understanding your current financial position, you’re better able to plan for the future. For example, if you want to fund a new ministry initiative, the information provided by the statements can help you decide when the best time might be and how it might be funded.</p>\n<p>In addition, by analyzing the figures, you can discover ways to reduce expenses and increase cash flow. Because the financial statement is a reflection of financial decisions, if there are budgetary discrepancies, they can be identified and corrected. This evaluation process helps a church become financially healthy, providing a stable foundation to do the ministry they have been called to do.</p>\n<h3>3. Obtaining Financing</h3>\n<p>Financial statements help lenders evaluate their risk in lending to you. It’s important to obtain statements on a regular basis <strong>before</strong> you’re in the market for a loan, so any problems can be corrected well ahead of time. When it’s time to borrow, you’ll want your statements to reflect a healthy financial position. If they are incomplete or not in a standard format (GAAP), you may not be considered a good lending candidate. For example, if your current liabilities (payables) consistently exceed current assets (cash and receivables), a lender may conclude you have a cash flow problem that could result in an inability to pay back a loan. On the other hand, perhaps church attendance is up and giving has increased. Your financial statement will reflect the income and support your efforts to obtain funding. In addition, the amount of income, trends in giving, and how funds are spent all help a potential lender know how much a church can afford to borrow.</p>\n<h3>Recommendations</h3>\n<p>Seek out a licensed certified public accountant (CPA) or reputable accounting firm to prepare your statements. A CPA is required to keep up with current practices and standards. Do your research and take time to meet with the firm to discuss their types of services and costs. Accounting firms provide a wide range of services from daily bookkeeping to annual auditing. Depending on your number of daily accounting transactions and your needs, you can determine the best services and frequency of statements with your accountant. Most small churches and organizations do not need audited financial statements and may find that quarterly or annually compiled statements are sufficient. Quarterly compiled financial statements for a small to medium-sized church could cost from $350 to $500 per quarter. It’s a small price to pay for being able to present an organized, accurate financial picture of your church.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Using a certified public accountant (CPA) for your church finances can benefit your ministry in several ways. Depending on your needs, CPAs can be hired by the church as in-house staff, or services can be provided by a CPA firm. Consider these five reasons to hire a CPA for your church:</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2 >1. They understand current accounting practices.</h2>\n<p>CPAs are required to pass competency tests and meet strict licensing requirements in order to practice. In addition, they must stay up to date on current accounting standards. From daily bookkeeping to annual auditing, a CPA can also help you determine what services your organization may need.</p>\n<h2 >2. They will prepare your financials using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).</h2>\n<p>Obtaining financial statements is recommended for every church, although the format and frequency may vary based on church size and the intended user, whether leadership, the congregation, or a potential lender. The advantage of a CPA is that they can prepare your financials using GAAP. This is a set of standards used in the U.S. to consistently report accounting information. Financials prepared using GAAP can be read by most financial institutions and help your church project a professional image. Quarterly compiled statements could cost as low as $350-$500 and are well worth the investment.</p>\n<h2 >3. They can help you avoid payroll tax liability.</h2>\n<p>Without proper training and experience, it’s easy to improperly file payroll tax returns, which could leave your church with costly tax liabilities. Even if you currently use an in-house bookkeeper for most accounting, consider hiring a CPA for payroll.</p>\n<h2 >4. They can help your church maintain accountability and protect against fraud.</h2>\n<p>A professional review or audit by a CPA will provide assurance on the finances of the church. At minimum, consider periodic reviews of internal controls and accounts susceptible to fraud or mismanagement. This is especially important if your church budget (tithes, missions, and building fund combined) has reached $1 million or more. An CPA firm can work with you to identify agreed-upon procedures for handling church funds and can assess your practices against them to ensure maximum protection.</p>\n<h2 >5. They can help you qualify for a church loan.</h2>\n<p>Having a CPA perform periodic audits or reviews not only maintains accountability but may also be a requirement for obtaining a loan or grant. In addition, as mentioned above, GAAP prepared financials help your church project a professional image to potential lenders. In fact, a lender will often require this before they will consider you for a large loan. It’s something to keep in mind if you intend to finance your next expansion project. <a href=\"/church-loans/\">Click here</a> for more information about ministry financing.</p>\n<p>Although your church may not need the services of a CPA on a regular basis now, as you grow, hiring one will help ensure proper accounting, reporting, and compliance.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>The new crib laws for daycare centers and churches take effect on <strong>December 28, 2012</strong>. As of that date, it is mandatory that all child care facilities must comply with the <strong>revised safety standards</strong>. Regarding the entities required to comply with these new standards, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has offered the following clarification, <!--more-->“we consider a child care facility to mean a nonresidential setting that provides child care services (which could include early learning opportunities) for a fee.” Note that the key wording is <em>“for a fee”.</em> With that condition, these regulations would <em>not</em> apply to a situation where volunteers care for children during a church service, no fee was charged to the parents, and the volunteers were not compensated.</p>\n<p>However, churches and organization that do not charge a fee for nursery services or compensate nursery workers <strong>should</strong> still take note of these revised standards.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Many churches approach their building program in a step-by-step manner as if they were making macaroni and cheese from a box. However, most building programs are more like a gourmet meal. Many things need to happen simultaneously in order to achieve the desired result. So rather than thinking in terms of who to call first – the architect, lender or builder – call all of them. Getting input from each source will allow you to see the project from multiple perspectives. You can then use this input to create the right “recipe” for your goals and price point.</p>\n<p>\"Who do you call first? The lender, architect, or builder?\" This is the most common question we hear as we work with churches across the country. It can be difficult to know where to start. <!--more-->To get the loan, the lender wants to know how much the project will cost and what it will look like. The design is necessary in order to get contractors to price the project, but it costs money to hire an architect and design a building. And should you pay an architect without a loan? Beginning a new building project can be enough to make your head spin. Here are some things to keep in mind as you begin.</p>\n<h2>First Steps</h2>\n<p><strong>Evaluate the need. </strong>Before contacting the parties that will be involved in your project, take time to reflect on the purpose of your project. What are the core needs of your ministry? Where are your largest growth areas? Be sure to build your project on the foundation of the goals and vision of your ministry. Ministry need should always drive the project. Taking the time to consider these items prior to beginning your project will help ensure that your new facilities meet your current and future needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Consider your resources.</strong> Consider where you are financially. In other words, what can you afford? This can be determined by evaluating your cash position, fundraising or stewardship potential, and borrowing capacity. Your cash position is the money you’ve set aside for the project. Make a clear distinction between this money and your cash-on-hand for operating and/or emergencies. Do not deplete your operating cash in order to build as this could cripple your ministry. Your stewardship opportunity is the amount you could potentially raise from your congregation and ministry partners to help fund the project. Finally, your borrowing capacity is your debt capacity in light of your ministries, missions giving, salaries, etc. Keep in mind that what you can borrow and what you should borrow are not always the same. Think of this amount as your borrowing boundary – not as the final amount you should borrow. These items combined will give you a benchmark for the possible scale of your project.</p>\n<h2>Talking to a Lender</h2>\n<p>When looking for a lender, find one that you trust. It is also important to have a lender who understands church finances, budgets, and ministry at large. Your initial call with a lender will help you get a feel for what their underwriting standards are as well as what documentation you’ll need to provide to determine loan qualification. For an initial loan qualification, most lenders will ask for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Financials</strong> - Three years of financial statements presented in generally accepted accounting practice (often referred to as GAAP) and a current year-to-date financial statement.</li>\n<li><strong>Appraisal or Broker’s Opinion of Value </strong>- Current market value of your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some lenders identify all your income as a potential debt repayment source. This is dangerous, as it could compromise your financial commitments to various ministries and missions. Make sure you look at the big picture. A good lender will not simply talk about how much you <em>can</em> borrow, but how much you <em>should</em> borrow, as well as what other options there may be for you. In other words, discuss a financing strategy rather than just a loan. A strategy may include some type of stewardship campaign to help capitalize the project, minimize the loan, and involve your congregation in the process.</p>\n<h2>Project Scope</h2>\n<p>In this step, you will begin building on the ministry needs and goals that you initially defined. Use that context to work with your designer and/or contractor. The end result should be a clearly defined project scope that meets your needs and a budget that fits what you can afford. While you are working with a lender, you should also begin identifying the project and associated cost. This can be accomplished with the help of a builder, architect, consultant, or even resources within your own church. Here are a few of the more common professional resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contractors and Design-Build Firms.</strong> Many firms, especially those used to working with churches, will assist in initial project identification and estimation for no up-front costs in exchange for an opportunity to be your builder when the project progresses.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Architect/Professional Designers.</strong> Architects often structure their services in four phases: preliminary design and/or site planning, schematics, design development, and construction drawings. You do not need to agree to all of these services up front. If you simply need to establish some parameters of a project in order to get an idea of cost and scope, request only the initial phase. Although this will not provide you with firm pricing for a project, it is usually enough to determine a price range so you can determine if you are within your budget. As you move through the process, be careful not to let the architect’s design of the building be the driving force. Instead, let ministry need and your church’s vision drive the project.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Building Coaches/Other Church Consultants.</strong> Churches are a very specific field of construction and can be considered a hybrid of commercial and residential construction. Some churches elect to hire a “coach” or consultant to lead them through the process. Many of these experts can assist in the initial project identification through needs and ministry analysis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Speaking with several experts simultaneously will help bring clarity to the process, project, and budget that are right for your ministry. Their expertise will also keep the project running smoothly throughout the process. As you begin to get the ball rolling in each of these areas, keep God’s vision for your ministry at the center. The Lord will guide and direct. It’s not the architect, the builder, or the lender you want calling the shots in this program. It’s Him.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

There is no real reason to do it.”</p>\n<p>Church risk management professional Jerry Sparks also advises church leaders and volunteers to simply communicate with parents or have a group blog, discouraging one-on-one communication with minors through social media.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><h4>Litigation discovery</h4>\n<p> Before you post anything on social media, think of potential legal ramifications. The harvesting of past social media communications is now a common way for legal teams to find incriminating statements which can be used against you in a court of law.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><h4>Personally identifiable information and photos of minors</h4>\n<p> Church websites and Facebook pages often share personally identifiable information, which an outsider can use to contact a minor. This exposes children not only to predators, but also to non-custodial biological parents who may try to contact their children against court orders. Protect minors by never posting birth dates, phone numbers, email addresses, or school names. In addition, always seek written permission from people to post their photograph and written permission from parents or guardians to post photos of minors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<h4>Defamation, confidentiality, and invasion of privacy</h4>\n<p> If an internal dispute occurs, any disparaging comments about individuals posted online by church staff or employees may be considered defamation, putting the church at risk for a lawsuit. Avoid any disclosure of private facts about people or situations unless you have permission. Never post something that might be confidential without checking first. A classic mistake many churches make is posting prayer needs along with people’s names.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><h4>Copyright infringement</h4>\n<p> It is against the law to utilize articles, photos, music, or other materials without obtaining permission first. <em>It’s not enough to simply give attribution to the author when posting.</em> In order to legally post copyrighted material, whether it’s a sermon from a visiting evangelist or a video of your worship service containing copyrighted music, you must have the proper authorization. This can either be through a license the church holds or directly from the owner of the copyrighted material.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><h4>Adverse employment decisions</h4>\n<p> In many states it is now illegal for an employer to take adverse employment action against an employee for making disparaging or critical remarks against the company or its leaders on his or her own social media account, unless they’re violating a policy they agreed to upon employment. These laws apply to churches and other nonprofits. Avoid liability by including a social media policy in your employee handbook, with stated consequences for violations.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In light of the risks surrounding social media, it’s important to take measures that protect your church. These tips will get you started:</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Document all current and intended use by staff and employees.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Implement safeguards.</strong> These include disclaimers on employees’ personal accounts; permission for the use of photos, videos, and copyrighted material; and protection of confidentiality.</li>\n<li><strong>Train employees on proper and improper use. </strong></li>\n<li><strong>Monitor the church website and social media posts by others</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>Because social media is a dynamic issue, it is best to seek legal counsel for any questions or issues that may arise.</p>\n<p>For more information about reducing social media risk, call AGFinancial Insurance Solutions at 866.621.1787.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Due to both low construction costs and low interest rates, a lot of growing churches are in the market for a loan. Most people are familiar with residential mortgages, but a church is considered a commercial enterprise, requiring a commercial mortgage. <!--more--> In order to accurately compare mortgage products to find the solution that is best for your church, it is important to understand the key differences between residential and commercial loans as well as the terminology used to describe the various products.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest differences with a commercial mortgage when compared to a residential loan is the <strong><em>term</em></strong>, or length of time until maturity of the loan versus the <strong><em>amortization</em></strong>, or payment schedule, of the loan.</p>\n<p>To best understand this difference, let’s look at a typical 30-year residential mortgage. The amortization and the term are both 30 years. That means your payments are scheduled out over 360 monthly fixed payments, or 30 years (the amortization), and you also have 30 years to repay the loan (the term). With a 15-year mortgage, your payments are scheduled out over 15 years, and you have 15 years to repay the loan.</p>\n<p>With commercial mortgages, however, <strong><em>the amortization and term are usually different amounts of time</em></strong>. So even though your payments are scheduled out over a certain number of years, you may not have that same number of years to repay it. For instance, if the term of the loan is a shorter amount of time than the amortization, <em>the entire remaining principle balance will be due at the end of the term.</em> This is called a balloon payment.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have cash to pay this balloon payment (the entire remaining balance of the loan), then you will have to refinance and get a new loan. That’s why it’s important to consider the term of the loan even before you look at the other factors, such as the interest rate and closing costs.</p>\n<p>Just like in residential mortgages, the shorter the term of a commercial loan, the lower your interest rate will be. For example, the rate on a 15-year residential mortgage is generally lower than a 30-year. With commercial loans, most banks and credit unions offer terms as short as 3 or 5 years.</p>\n<p><strong>While the interest rate with such a short term can be enticing, it can end up costing you much more in the long run</strong><em>.</em></p>\n<p>Here are some reasons why:</p>\n<ol>\n<li >If you refinance a balloon note when it’s due, you have to pay <strong>closing costs</strong> again (including any origination fees and third-party fees like appraisals and surveys) to borrow the <em>same money</em> you already had borrowed.</li>\n<li >When you refinance your balloon note, your new loan will be subject to whatever the <strong>interest rate</strong> market is at the time. You have no guarantee or cap on how much your rate may increase with the new loan, and there is no way to predict what interest rates will be at that time.</li>\n<li >If you look at the amortization schedule for your residential mortgage, you’ll notice that the bulk of the interest is paid at the beginning of the loan. When you refinance a balloon note, it’s like starting over. You will again be <strong>paying more interest</strong> and very little principal with each payment.</li>\n<li >When you refinance, you must <strong>qualify</strong> for the new loan. If there are changes in your property value, revenue, personnel costs, etc., you could find yourself in a different situation than when you borrowed the money the first time. In unfortunate cases where a bank can’t or won’t refinance a church loan, it leaves the church scrambling to find someone else to lend them the money they need so that they can keep their property.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Consider the following best-practice recommendations when shopping for a church loan:</p>\n<ol>\n<li ><strong>Understand what interest rate terms may mean for you.</strong><br />\nMany banks refer to balloon notes as “fixed rate loans.” This is somewhat deceiving. While “fixed rate” has a positive connotation in the residential market when the loan term is 15 or 30 years, on a 5-year balloon note, the rate is only fixed for the 5-year term. The benefit of an adjustable rate loan in the commercial mortgage market is that you know up front how high your rate is allowed to go. Plus, the loan is guaranteed to remain until you pay off the entire balance.</li>\n<li ><strong>Don’t borrow more than you can afford.</strong><br />\nOnly consider your tithes and offering income when determining how much your church can afford to borrow. Designated income, such as missions and benevolence, should not be used to pay your mortgage.</li>\n<li ><strong>Borrow for the longest period possible.</strong><br />\nHaving a longer amortization schedule (and therefore lower payments) can give you the flexibility in your budget for cash flow fluctuation. No matter how accurate your projection, some months your income will be lower than others. Don’t let your ministry suffer because you’re committed to a larger loan payment.</li>\n<li ><strong>Pay off your loan as quickly as possible.</strong><br />\nSome months your income may be higher than expected. Use that extra cash to pay down your debt. As you shop for loans, make sure you don’t have a prepayment penalty so that you can take every opportunity to make extra principal payments on your loan and save your ministry money on interest in the long run.</li>\n<li ><strong>Mitigate the long-term risks to your ministry.</strong><br />\nIt is important that we are wise stewards of the ministry and resources God has entrusted to us. You can’t afford to look at the future of your ministry in 5-year increments. To avoid incurring the costs and risks of refinancing every few years, look for a loan with a longer term rather than a shorter term.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As you search for the loan solution that is best for your ministry, we invite you to contact us to discuss your options. Call <strong>866.621.1787</strong> to set up a time to speak with a loan consultant.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Although tax laws change, one thing stays the same: It is more blessed to give than to receive. With giving comes the added blessing of being able to claim donations on your tax return—a smart financial move for your family. May you enjoy the act of giving this season, keeping the following in mind for maximum 2014 tax savings.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Before December 31, 2014:</h2>\n<p><strong>Verify the charity’s tax status.</strong></p>\n<p>An organization must have federal tax exempt status for your donation to be tax deductible. Make sure the organization you’re donating to qualifies, especially if it is one you’ve never given to before. The easiest way to verify is to ask whether they have received a 501(c)(3) determination letter from the IRS. You can look up many organizations on the IRS website to see if they have been declared a “public charity,” which is the designation they receive when the 501(c)(3) application is approved. Churches, by their nature, are tax exempt under federal law. Some charities may not have their own 501(c)(3) determination letter but instead fall under the tax exempt umbrella of another related charity.</p>\n<p><strong>Know this year’s deduction limits.</strong></p>\n<p>There is no limit on how much you give in any year, but the IRS limits how much you can deduct on your taxes for your giving. Deduction limits are dependent on the type of property you give and the type of organization to which you give. Gifts to public charities are generally more deductible than gifts to private foundations. And you can claim higher deductions for gifts of cash and securities than gifts of real estate. If you give more than you can deduct in any given year, you can often carry forward deductions into future years.</p>\n<p>If you plan to give to individuals, make sure you take note of gift tax limits. Keeping gifts to your children or grandchildren under the gift tax annual exemption will save you from gift tax headaches. For 2014, the IRS allows a person to give a total of $14,000 to any number of recipients free from any gift tax. This means a husband and wife can transfer $28,000 (two $14,000 gifts) to the same individual or several people.</p>\n<p><strong>Meet the deadline.</strong></p>\n<p>If you want to deduct your contribution for the 2014 tax year, make sure it is postmarked by December 31, 2014. Credit card donations also count as long as the contribution is made by that day.</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure donated clothing and household items are in good condition.</strong></p>\n<p>This rule applies to furniture, furnishings, electronics, appliances, and linens. Non-cash contributions greater than $250 require documentation and substantiation to support the gift. If you deduct more than $5,000 for an item, you must include a qualified appraisal of the item. In addition, if your total deduction for all non-cash donations is over $500, you will have to submit Form 8283 with your return.</p>\n<p><strong>Get a receipt.</strong></p>\n<p>For any donation of $250 or more, you must obtain an acknowledgement from a charity. This applies to both money and property. Receipts should show the name of the charity, the date, the amount donated, and a reasonably detailed description of the property donated. If no one is available to give you a receipt when you drop off your goods, keep a written record of this information yourself, as well as the fair market value of the donated items and how this was determined.</p>\n<p><strong>Special note on vehicles:</strong></p>\n<p>If you wish to donate a car, your deduction amount will be based on how the charity uses it or, if they sell it, the price it receives. Ask the organization to provide you with Form 1098-C.</p>\n<h2>Before April 15, 2015:</h2>\n<p><strong>Itemize.</strong></p>\n<p>You must <strong>itemize your deductions</strong> using Form 1040 Schedule A. If you simply use the standard deduction, charitable giving contributions will not be counted. Keep in mind, you’ll only be able to save on taxes if your total itemized deductions are more than what the standard deduction amount would be.</p>\n<p>To view the IRS regulations for year-end giving, <a title=\"click here\" href=\"http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc506.html\">click here</a>.</p>\n<p>To explore options that can help you prepare and possibly save money at tax time, contact one of our planned giving consultants today at <strong>866.892.0629</strong>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Have a big vision but a small budget? You're not alone. If a large-scale project is out of the question right now, you can still dramatically improve the ministry function of your facilities through modest upgrades, such as these:</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>1. Create a connection space.</h2>\n<p>Gone are the days of the foyer being just a place to hang your coat and enter the sanctuary. Today’s buzzwords are <em>third space</em> and <em>connection space</em>. This is a common area designed for hanging out. It may be a wide-open area used to congregate before and after service. Some are designed to have a cafe feel with coffee bars, tables, and sitting areas to create multiple conversation venues. A good connection space often doubles as a classroom or banquet hall for special gatherings. For the first-time visitor, this is where they will often have their first impression of your church.</p>\n<h2>2. Update the sanctuary.</h2>\n<p>Trading pews for chairs is one of the most popular upgrades we see happening in worship spaces today. The decision can cause division, so it’s best to consider what best fits the DNA of your church. However, it’s true that you can seat more people with chairs than pews. In addition, if the worship space is not a dedicated sanctuary, chairs allow flexibility for room set-up and configuration. Consider storage options for chairs when not in use, as well as flooring that is durable and easy to clean.</p>\n<h2>3. Prioritize the nursery and children’s areas.</h2>\n<p>Investing in quality spaces for your nursery and children’s ministry reflects how much your church values families. At minimum, a good nursery space should have the following attributes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proximity to parents</li>\n<li>A secure drop-off/pick-up area and other recommended security measures, such as cameras in each room</li>\n<li>Equipment that complies with <a title=\"federal safety requirements\" href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid92798crib-safety-deadline-for-child-care-facilities/\">federal safety requirements</a></li>\n<li>Cleanliness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For kids’ spaces, updating the decor and upgrading security makes kids feel welcome and parents feel good about bringing their children. In addition, many churches invest in <a title=\"electronic check-in systems\" href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid107735managing-church-risk-a-view-from-the-trenches/\">electronic check-in systems</a> that improve both safety and convenience.</p>\n<h2>4. Construct a gym or multi-purpose facility.</h2>\n<p>Sometimes referred to as family life centers, these buildings are typically one of the most efficient types of spaces to build. They offer flexible space that can be shared by different ministries as well as the community through athletic programs and gatherings. Often, construction of these facilities is accompanied by outdoor athletic fields. Some churches will even use the space for Sunday worship.</p>\n<h2>5. Exhibit the right signs.</h2>\n<p>Signs are important for providing information and a sense of security and attraction for visitors. Try to look at your facility from a newcomer's perspective and find ways to make it welcoming and easy to navigate. Updating the main exterior sign is a good place to start, but you may also consider adding designated visitor parking close to the entrace and other directional signs around the church gounds. Keep in mind, updating exterior signage may require a permit. Inside, make sure all meeting rooms, restrooms, children's areas, and offices are clearly labeled.</p>\n<h2>6. Provide outdoor shelter.</h2>\n<p>Depending on your climate, canopies can be an inviting architectural element of a building, making it obvious where the front door is, and can also provide essential protection from bad weather. In addition, sheltered outdoor connection spaces are becoming recognized as an effective venue for ministry.</p>\n<h2>7. Explore new technology.</h2>\n<p>For most churches, improvements to media infrastructure and equipment is ongoing, but if you haven’t made changes in a while, it may be time to enhance your ministry spaces with new multi-media capabilities. Audio, video, lighting, and other media upgrades can be incorporated into classrooms, small group spaces, the foyer, connection spaces, children’s ministry areas, and the sanctuary.</p>\n<h2>8. Make a good impression.</h2>\n<p>Well-maintained, attractive, and inviting buildings elicit a positive response from new guests, as well as people who have attended your church for years. The good news is it doesn’t have to cost much to make an old space feel new again. Here are some ideas, many of which can be done with the help of volunteers and may not all require contractors:</p>\n<h3>Outside:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Attractive landscaping</li>\n<li>Fresh paint</li>\n<li>A new roof</li>\n<li>Eye-catching banners (make sure you obtain all necessary permits and change out the banners occasionally to keep attention)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Inside:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fresh paint in coordinating colors</li>\n<li>New flooring, such as carpet, tile, stained concrete, or even area rugs</li>\n<li>Updated light fixtures</li>\n<li>Restroom upgrades, including new faucets, countertops, mirrors, and partitions</li>\n<li>Fresh flowers, artwork, accessories, and seating arrangements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether you would like to simply renovate your current facilities or are interested in new construction, we can help with planning and funding.

That income is subject to standard taxation.</p>\n<h4><strong>Myth #2: The allowance stops once I retire.</strong></h4>\n<p>Fact: Retired ministers may declare a housing allowance on distributions from their AGFinancial 403(b) account, rendering that portion of their distributions tax-free<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>This is a unique benefit of this retirement plan. Here is how it works: AGFinancial automatically designates 100% of a minister’s 403(b) distributions as housing. The minister must then determine and report their actual housing allowance amount on their Form 1040. The amount claimed must be the lesser of either your actual housing expenses for the year or the actual fair rental value as furnished.</p>\n<p>For a list of expenses that qualify, <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid97451housing-allowance-what-every-retired-minister-should-know/\">click here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Keep in mind, as explained above, a housing allowance can only be declared for income earned in the service as a minister. This applies to rollovers or transfers into your 403(b), as well as money contributed directly to it. In other words, you cannot transfer money from other retirement accounts into your AGFinancial 403(b) account and use retired clergy housing allowance on those transferred funds.</em></p>\n<h4><strong>Myth #3: My spouse can declare a housing allowance on my income.</strong></h4>\n<p>Fact: As a credentialed minister, you can only declare a housing allowance for your own ministerial income.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>This rule also applies during retirement. Spouses may only declare a housing allowance for their own ministerial income as a credentialed minister.</p>\n<p>In addition, a spouse cannot declare a housing allowance on an inherited 403(b) account even if it belonged to a spouse who was credentialed.</p>\n<p>Because of these regulations, it’s very important for each credentialed spouse with ministry income to open their own 403(b) account and contribute to it.</p>\n<p>Also, consider the option of a Roth 403(b). This type of account has the benefit of allowing your spouse to receive distributions that are not taxable after your death. </p>\n<p>If you have additional questions regarding the minister’s housing allowance, feel free to give our office a call at <strong>866.621.1787</strong> or email <a href=\"mailto:retirement@agfinancial.org\">retirement@agfinancial.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Rob Ketterling led River Valley Church in Apple Valley, Minnesota, as they expanded to eight campuses in the U.S. and overseas and are now reaching over 6,500 people. We recently sat down with him to get his perspective on healthy strategies for church growth. </p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3 >Tell us a little about the DNA of River Valley Church and your growth journey.</h3>\n<p>When we started about 20 years ago, we were very traditional, and over the years we’ve just morphed. I’ve said if you took Hillsong, Willow Creek, and Fellowship Church and threw them in a blender, you might find us. When we went multi-site, we did it because our church was full. We actually went multi-service first, then we gave people away to start a church, then we grew more, then we went multi-site. I learned you need to go multi-service before you go multi-site, because it will help your congregation understand multi-site. Also, if you’re willing to give people away to start a new church, every person in your church knows you’re serious about reaching lost people. The thought process is, “Our pastor loves reaching lost people so much he gave people away—I need to invite someone.” All of a sudden you have more people coming in than you can handle.</p>\n<h3 >What would you consider to be the most important things needed to support healthy church growth?</h3>\n<p>Trust is key. If people trust you as a leader, I’ve learned they’ll go practically anywhere with you. I’ve also learned two things keep you from having problems: church growth and budget growth. So, keep winning people to Jesus and handle your finances right.</p>\n<p>To support church growth, one of the biggest things for us was giving ministry away. I learned that the first 200 people in the church came because they liked the pastor and bought the vision. The next 200 people came because of the staff and the ministry they were receiving. After that, it was a question of whether there was a place for them to use their ministry gifts. The more I gave ministry away—Bible studies, ushering, greeting, hospital visits—the more we grew.</p>\n<p>To support a healthy budget, a key philosophy we’ve maintained is to pay for comfort with cash and use financing for expansion. Here’s what I mean: If we want to make a room nicer and more comfortable for people, we’ll raise cash. If we want to add on for more people to join us, we’ll take a loan.</p>\n<h3 >What would you say to help growing churches prepare to talk to a lender?</h3>\n<p>Once your church hits a certain size, has money, and wants to do something with a building, everybody that wouldn’t give you a loan before will now. So it’s important to work with a financial institution that understands ministry and church growth. They’re going to be able to look at more than just the bottom line. They’ll know that if you start a church and it grows, you’re going to need another phase … and another … and another, and they’re not going to be freaked out by multi-site. </p>\n<p>For more great insight from Rob, you can check out <a href=\"http://robketterling.com\">his blog</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robketterling\">follow him on Twitter</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Although we frequently discuss <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid105451churches-6-steps-to-keep-your-kids-safe/\">child safety and volunteers</a>, it’s also important to keep these additional areas in mind:</p>\n<h2>Volunteers and church construction</h2>\n<p>Many churches feel using congregational volunteers for construction or renovation projects will save money while providing ministry opportunity that will produce an increased sense of ownership. However, caution is warranted. Be aware that churches can easily spend more on materials for volunteers than a contractor would charge in labor and material combined. In addition, churches may need to stretch construction schedules to accommodate volunteers. Unfortunately, this may then lead to additional interest accrued on their construction loan, which may negate any potential savings and increase the project cost. And remember, unlike with licensed, insured, professional contractors, there is no warranty on work produced by volunteers.</p>\n<p>Consider the following before using volunteers for any construction project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Does the job require skill?</strong> Painting a classroom may not need to be outsourced, but things involving plumbing, electrical, and structural changes are best left to professionals.</li>\n<li><strong>What are the expectations of the church and the volunteer?</strong> Be specific about expectations upfront and recognize that a church is not in a position to hold volunteers accountable for costs, time frames, or work quality.</li>\n<li><strong>Does your church liability insurance cover volunteer labor?</strong> Verify that your general liability coverage is adequate for potential injuries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Volunteers and food</h2>\n<p>Every year millions of people in the U.S. experience the discomfort of the stomach flu. Many of these cases may actually be undiagnosed food poisoning. Proper food handling protects your congregants and volunteers from foodborne illnesses and your church from potential liability.</p>\n<p>Recommendations for churches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appoint a kitchen/food manager for the church to oversee all food-related activities</li>\n<li>Abide by state and city regulations for safe food handling and potentially require certification for people working with food, possibly including Hepatitis A vaccination/testing. For up-to-date info on regulations in your area, visit <a href=\"http://www.servsafe.com\">www.servsafe.com</a>.</li>\n<li>If your church charges for the food it prepares and serves, be aware that this constitutes having a restaurant and could put the church at risk for a lawsuit if someone becomes sick.</li>\n<li>Even if no money is charged for the meal prepped and served by the church, the church should abide by regulations for food safety, such as storing all food at least six inches off the floor and following proper hand washing protocols and glove use.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Volunteers and insurance</h2>\n<p>In addition to general liability, it’s recommended that churches carry two additional liability coverages to protect your volunteers and church:</p>\n<ol>\n<li ><strong>Directors’ and officers’</strong><br />\nThis is coverage for decisions made by your board, officers, or trustees. Even though many states offer protection for volunteer board members of nonprofit organizations, there can still be significant defense costs should someone bring legal action against board members. We recommend limits of $1 million for most churches while larger churches or those with significantly more assets need to consider higher amounts.</li>\n<li ><strong>Sexual misconduct</strong><br />\nNot only is it wise to have coverage for a real incident but also to defend against an allegation. Defense costs can climb into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The amount paid to the plaintiff is often substantial, and can force a church into bankruptcy or liquidation. Many companies will require churches to meet screening and supervision standards to obtain higher coverage limits. A church needs to have a minimum of $250,000 and should strive to obtain higher limits if at all possible. Ask your insurance agent if defense cost is inside or outside of your limit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more information on minimizing church risk and obtaining proper insurance coverage for your ministry, call 866.621.1787 or email <a href=\"mailto:info@agfinancialinsurance.org\">info@agfinancialinsurance.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>\"It's easier to prepare and prevent, than to repair and repent.\" - Author unknown</p>\n<p>When the unexpected happens, will your church be ready? Most church insurance claims and lawsuits can be prevented with a little planning and preparation. That’s why we’re focusing on risk management in this second installment of our September series on church preparedness.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>As a pastor, it's helpful to think of yourself as a risk manager for your church and its people. Mitigating church risk is an ongoing process, and the following steps will help you tackle it effectively:</p>\n<h2>1. Identify risk.</h2>\n<p>Develop a habit of looking for potentially high-risk areas within your facilities and ministry activities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Physical inspections.</strong> Walk through your facilities and property looking for things that may pose a hazard. Slipping, tripping, and falling accidents account for the vast majority of liability insurance claims.</li>\n<li><strong>Checklist and procedure reviews. </strong>Establish a variety of checklists and implement them into your procedures. Common checklists include vehicle inspection, kitchen safety, property inspection, and <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid108051safety-checklist-for-your-church-nursery/\">nursery safety</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Leases and contracts. </strong>Do not sign contracts that transfer risk and liability to your organization, as they can often be negotiated or rewritten to more favorable terms. One of the most common scenarios is when a church rents inflatables for an event.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Control risk.</h2>\n<p>It's important to assess the likelihood of an accident and its potential financial impact on your ministry, such as increased premiums, damaged reputation, financial settlements, and legal fees. Consider the following methods to begin controlling risk:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prevention. </strong>Stop or interrupt the chain of events that could lead to an accident or a loss. By reviewing ministry procedures and developing protective policies, you can often prevent problems.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduction. </strong>Steps may be taken before or after a loss has occurred to minimize the damage and reduce its impact. For example, you can minimize your church's potential liability for child abuse by always running criminal background checks <strong>and</strong> contacting institutional references for all potential workers. In addition, maintain all physical documentation of these items to be able to provide to authorities in the event of an accusation. This protects your church, your workers, and, most importantly, children.</li>\n<li><strong>Separation and duplication.</strong> Regular backups should be made of important information, such as tax documents, giving reports, licenses, personnel files, insurance policies, property inventory lists, and other sensitive data. In addition, files should be duplicated and stored off-site in the event your building is damaged or destroyed by fire or other disaster.</li>\n<li><strong>Transfers.</strong> You can physically transfer risk by allowing another individual or entity to perform duties. For example, by hiring local law enforcement officers to provide security for your church, liability transfers from your church to them when they respond to an emergency.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3. Implement smart policies.</h2>\n<p>Having solid risk management policies enables you to protect people, prevent incidents, and prove to a jury your church extended a reasonable level of care if you are sued. Start by creating a policy in each of the following areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abuse prevention for minors</li>\n<li>Cell phone use</li>\n<li>Social media use</li>\n<li>Emergency response</li>\n<li>Facilities use</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4. Obtain proper insurance coverage.</h2>\n<p>Insurance is not a substitute for quality risk management. However, it enables your church to pay for unexpected events without financially crippling your ministry. Every church needs two types of insurance: liability and property. Liability covers the action that could leave the church liable for damage to others (injuries, property, or reputation) while property covers the things you own.</p>\n<p>It is recommended for churches to seek coverage with an insurance company that has A.M. Best's credit rating of A- or better, financial size VI or higher, and an agent that is knowledgeable about insuring churches. In addition, it is a good practice to evaluate your policies on a regular basis as your needs may change from year to year.</p>\n<p>The General Council of the Assemblies of God has a customized insurance program for AG churches available through AGFinancial Insurance Solutions in partnership with Church Mutual, the largest church writer in the world.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Unfortunately, too many churches fully design a building only to realize later that it cannot be built due to outside requirements and regulations imposed on them. <!--more--> <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid106383dr-richard-hammar-zones-in-on-multi-site-church-expansion/\">Zoning</a>, site plan approval, building permits, change of use requests, parking requirements—these are just a few examples of the kind of red tape that can complicate church construction projects. While you may not be able to avoid all issues, you can overcome them with the five strategies outlined below.</p>\n<p>But first, consider this story:</p>\n<p>A church spent significant funds purchasing property and designing plans for a new building. After submitting their plans to local authorities, they were told that a turn-lane would be required to provide access to the new building. The requirement was non-negotiable and, unfortunately, complying would mean they couldn’t afford to build.</p>\n<p>Stories like this underscore the need to look ahead so you can plan your schedule and budget to accommodate them. Here are some ways to do that:</p>\n<h2>1. Identify sources of red tape.</h2>\n<p>Before you begin planning a building project, identify the entities that could potentially have jurisdiction over your site. In rural areas, there may be relatively few. For these churches, we recommend paying attention to potential long-term liability issues, such as <a href=\"http://www.ada.gov/2010ADAstandards_index.htm\">ADA compliance</a>. However, the majority of expanding churches are located in places where multiple entities regulate development and construction. Identifying them will give you a heads up about the issues you may have to deal with.</p>\n<h2>2. Consult professionals.</h2>\n<p>Think of your building project in two parts: the site and the building. For site-related issues, contact a civil engineer early in the planning process. They can alert you to potential problems and help assess the property <em>before</em> purchasing.</p>\n<p>Building-related issues can be handled by a general contractor, architect, design-builder, or another local construction specialist. These professionals can help you identify the local entities that can affect requirements and regulations for your project.</p>\n<h2>3. Review before finalizing design.</h2>\n<p>Small changes in the way a site plan or building is drawn can have a big impact. Once you’ve <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid90510church-construction-building-your-building-team/\">assembled your building team</a>, request a preliminary design that can be submitted to local building authorities, utility providers, and other state and local agencies for an initial review prior to finalizing design. This allows you to price-check the project as you go and keep it within your budget.</p>\n<h2>4. Negotiate.</h2>\n<p>Local authorities usually have working relationships with building professionals in their area, so your contractor or design-builder may be able to negotiate on your behalf to help minimize red tape. This may involve some give and take and also depends on their knowledge of local code and how it’s applied.</p>\n<h2>5. Take advantage of city incentives.</h2>\n<p>One Chicago church designed their building with an environmentally friendly roof, as part of the city's effort toward greener building practices. In addition to saving on energy costs long-term, the church was rewarded with a shorter building permit review period, saving them weeks of time.</p>\n<p>Although dealing with at least some red tape is an inevitable part of church construction, it’s important to maintain a positive attitude. Many regulations and restrictions are there to help ensure the safety and functionality of your church. So don’t let red tape discourage you; it’s just part of the journey.</p>\n<p>If you would like more information on best practices for building or renovating, feel free to call 866.621.1787 or email me at <a href=\"mailto:sfink@agfinancial.org\">sfink@agfinancial.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Welcome to the third and final part in our church preparedness series. In the first two posts, we discussed <a href=/blog/bid108176prepared-for-rainy-days-how-to-build-a-church-emergency-fund/\">how to build church emergency savings</a> and <a href=\"/blog/prepare-ministry-unexpected/\">risk management steps</a> every church should be taking.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Today we’ll identify common church budgeting mistakes with a suggested solution for each. As you begin planning your 2015 budget, be sure to steer clear of these classic blunders.</p>\n<h2>Blunder #1: No accountability for leaders .</h2>\n<p><strong>The Fix:</strong> All department/ministry leaders must be responsible for their budget preparation and be held accountable throughout the year for budget adherence.</p>\n<p>Regularly meet with key personnel to evaluate actual spending against the budget. This will help identify overspending and ensure ministry funding needs are met throughout the year.</p>\n<h2 >Blunder #2: Taking last year's budget and just increasing it.</h2>\n<p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Start your budget at zero every year.</p>\n<p>Every budgeted expenditure must be evaluated and justified each year. Needs and visions change, and so must the budget. In addition, review prior years’ actual expenditures to accurately account for seasonal giving trends and other expected needs.</p>\n<h2 >Blunder #3: Failing to budget for cash flow variations.</h2>\n<p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Consider revenue and expenses on a monthly basis so your budget reflects expected fluctuations in cash flow.</p>\n<p>For example, most churches experience lower giving and high utility expenses during the summer. It’s crucial to budget revenue conservatively when possible. Try to coordinate larger expenses with higher giving months. Otherwise, budget to have operational reserves in high cash flow months to cover months when giving is lower. Past monthly financial statements can help you accurately project these variations.</p>\n<h2 ><strong><img src=\"//cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/25853/file-1712937172-png/images/churchbudgetallocations.png\" alt=\"Churchbudgetallocations\" border=\"0\" /></strong></h2>\n<h2 >Blunder #4: Straying too far from recommended percentages.</h2>\n<p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Adhere to the recommended church budget allocations shown in the chart at right.</p>\n<h2 >Blunder #5: Saving nothing.</h2>\n<p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Allocate a portion of undesignated income each month toward building an emergency fund—enough to cover three to six months of expenses.</p>\n<p>You may need to cut expenses. The goal is to have more money coming in than going out. Use this positive cash flow to save for rainy days and fund new ministry initiatives.</p>\n<h2 >Blunder #6: No structure/template.</h2>\n<p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Download the church budget template below.</p>\n<p>Especially for new churches and those without accounting software, an easy-to-use template designed for church accounting makes budget planning much easier.</p>\n<h2 >Blunder #7: Failing to consider all cash needs, including capital expenditures, not just operating expenses.</h2>\n<p><strong>The Fix:</strong> While not an exhaustive list, consider the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Debt service and other balance sheet items</li>\n<li>Capital projects and expenditures</li>\n<li>Salary increases</li>\n<li>New hires</li>\n<li>New ministry programs</li>\n<li>Insurance premiums</li>\n<li>Equipment repairs and replacement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Be sure to allow for contingencies in case of budget overruns in any one area. When it comes to budget planning, it’s better to err on the side of being too conservative rather than too optimistic.</p>\n<p>Done right, adherence to a well-prepared budget is the foundation for godly stewardship of church finances. Your budget will also give you the information necessary to make wise strategic financial decisions for your ministry. Then as the ministry grows and it becomes necessary to seek financing for expansion or church investment advice, you’ll be well prepared for that next step.

The simplest, most effective way to build an emergency savings fund is to put it in the budget by allocating a portion of monthly income (undesignated tithes and offerings) as savings.</p>\n<h2><strong>Dispose of unused assets.</strong></h2>\n<p>If your church owns land, buildings, or vehicles which are no longer used or needed, consider selling those assets and using all or a portion of the funds to build church savings.</p>\n<h2><strong>Cut small expenses.</strong></h2>\n<p>Adjust the thermostat a degree or two. Ask volunteers to bring donuts/coffee instead of offering them free. Shop for less expensive service providers or cut the service altogether. For example, consider using volunteers for church cleaning and groundskeeping rather than a lawn care provider or janitorial service. By reducing or removing several small expenses, you can greatly increase your overall savings.</p>\n<h2><strong>Aim for 3-6 months of expenses.</strong></h2>\n<p>Although there's no single right answer for how much a church needs to maintain in reserve, this is a useful guideline. It may be that smaller churches should aim for a larger cushion because they may have fewer givers to help in a financial crisis. Larger churches may be able to get by with a smaller cushion if they have a large number of givers who can help maintain the stability of church income.</p>\n<h2><strong>Invest the cash.</strong></h2>\n<p>Since this money is for emergencies, it needs to be accessed easily, but ideally, you still want to earn some interest on the funds. Look for <a title=\"investment options\" href=\"/investments/types-of-investments/\">investment options</a> that are low risk and allow easy access to funds. To obtain the best return without sacrificing liquidity, consider investing with a <a title=\"laddering strategy\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLS35Et-nHKCyl_94XMi9PW2qp7hWbptkG&amp;v=h6dQaZq8X5k\">laddering strategy</a>.</p>\n<p>Although we trust in God's provision and help, wisdom demands a certain level of preparation for hard times. Building an emergency fund is one of the most practical ways to prepare. As one old Chinese proverb says, \"Dig the well before you are thirsty.\"</p>\n<p>In upcoming posts, we'll identify the four most critical risk management steps every church should take, as well as how to avoid common church budget blunders.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Most consumers deposit their cash into a checking and/or savings account, where the money earns very little, if any, return. But you don't have to settle for average. You can learn how to invest well and wisely, putting your money to work on your behalf. The first step is understanding compound interest.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>What is compound interest?</h2>\n<p>Unlike simple interest, which is earned only on your principal, compound interest is interest earned on top of interest. It can dramatically increase the growth of your savings.</p>\n<p>For example, if you invest $1,000 into an account that pays a compounding interest of 5.0% annually, at the end of the first year you’ll have $1,050. During the second year, you’ll be earning 5.0% on $1,050. At the end of the second year, you’ll have $1,102.50. After 20 years, without additional money put into the account, you’d have $2,653.30 (compared to $2,000.00 if you had only earned simple interest).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you continued to add money to the account you’d earn even more. Just $500 per year contributed over the course of 20 years at 5% would grow to $20,012.92.</p>\n<h2>How to calculate compound interest</h2>\n<p>Investment experts often use extensive charts and tables to help them quickly calculate compound interest, but there is a quick, easy calculation anybody can do. It’s called the rule of 72, and it tells you how many years it will take to double your money at any given interest rate.</p>\n<p>Simply take 72 and divide it by your rate. The result is the approximate number of years required to double your investment.</p>\n<p>For example, if you’re earning 5%, simple divide 72 by 5, which is 14.4. That means you can expect to wait a little over 14 years to double the amount of money you initially invest, if it continues to earn 5%.</p>\n<p>For your convenience, check out our easy <a title=\"investment calculators\" href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/investments/calculators/\">investment calculators</a>. You may be surprised at how quickly your money can grow.</p>\n<h2>Compound interest and debt</h2>\n<p>Albert Einstein purportedly said, “Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it … he who doesn’t … pays it.”</p>\n<p>Interest compounds on debts you owe, just like it does on investments; however, with a debt, you are the one paying the interest. The compounding can be especially damaging to your bottom line if the debt is on a high-interest credit card. For this reason, it's recommended to avoid high-interest debt altogether. If you're already in debt, do your best to pay more than just the minimum payment each month. In this way, you’ll drastically reduce the total amount of interest paid and be able to get out of debt faster.</p>\n<p>Need help finding extra cash? <a title=\"Download 52 Ways to Save.\" href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/52-ways-to-save-ebook/\">Download 52 Ways to Save.</a></p>\n<h2>How do I get started investing?</h2>\n<p>Anyone can invest.

We feel this information is timely and relevant for churches whose lenders may have suggested an Interest Rate Swap, as such contracts pose a risk to a ministry's financial health. If you have questions or would like more information, please call us at <strong>866.621.1787</strong>.</em></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>by Judith Fellheimer</p>\n<p>No business executive wakes up in the morning and decides that his Company needs to purchase an Interest Rate Swap (\"Swap\"). In fact, he probably doesn't even know what it is. What usually happens is that the executive, for whatever reason, needs to ask his bank (\"Lender\") for a loan and wants the loan at a fixed rate of interest. The Lender, however, prefers to grant the loan at a variable rate of interest. [Here’s where the Swap comes in.] To solve the problem, the Lender suggests that the executive consider turning his Company’s requested fixed-rate loan into a Swap.</p>\n<p>What exactly is a Swap? It’s a contract between a Company and an outside investor called a “Swap Party.” The swap contract is separate and apart from the loan agreement with the Company’s Lender. This new agreement enables the Company to pay the Lender at a fixed rate of interest over the life of the loan rather than the floating rate of interest that the Lender prefers. The function of the Swap Party is to accept the Company’s fixed rate interest payments for the five- to 10-year term of the loan, and then make variable rate interest payments to the Lender over the same time period. In other words, the Company pays the Swap Party and the Swap Party pays the lender.</p>\n<p>What the business executive doesn’t know is that even though the bank seems to be initiating the Swap, it is actually a separate security with its own profit component. The executive also doesn’t realize that the bank can make more money selling the Swap than it can earn by entering into a direct loan transaction with his Company.</p>\n<p>A bank will view any Company looking for a multimillion dollar loan for a term of five or more years at a fixed rate of interest, as a potential prospect for a Swap. The lending officer is trained to paint an attractive picture of the Swap by showing the Company that its interest costs will be lower with a Swap and the longer the swap period, the lower the interest rate. Some banks will not even offer a loan at a fixed rate for any period of time unless the Company takes a Swap.</p>\n<h2 ><strong>How Does the Swap Party Benefit from the Swap Contract?</strong></h2>\n<p>The Swap Party is a speculator who makes a wager that it will profit by taking the fixed rate interest payment from a Company and paying out the variable interest rate payment to the Company’s Lender over the life of the Swap. Depending on the terms of the Swap and the direction of interest rates over the life of the Swap, the Swap Party may or may not make a profit on its Swap wager. As interest rates fluctuate, the Swap Party makes a profit when the fixed rate exceeds the variable rate, and has a loss when the variable rate exceeds the fixed rate.</p>\n<p>Swaps are usually only offered to borrowers at times when the Swap Party believes that the movements of interest rates over the term of the Swap will be in its favor. And since Swap Parties are in the business of evaluating the interest rate markets, they are more often right than wrong about the movement of interest rates.</p>\n<p>However, the fact that the Swap Party makes a profit on its interest rate wager does not, in and of itself, make the Swap Contract a bad decision for a borrower. After all, if your Company achieves its objective of controlling future borrowing costs, and the Swap Party earns a profit on its interest rate speculation, why wouldn’t it be a good decision for both parties? As I will explain, there is a huge risk for any Company that enters into an Interest Rate Swap—a risk that doesn’t appear on the surface of the transaction.</p>\n<h2><strong>Will the Real Swap Party Please Stand Up?</strong></h2>\n<p>When entering into a Swap Contract, a Company is often given the false impression that the party on the other side of the Swap Contract is their Lender, and therefore the Swap Party will have the same interest in the survival of the Company as does the Lender. This is a reasonable conclusion for the Company to reach because the mechanics of presenting and signing the Swap Contract is usually handled by the Lender’s loan officer. In addition, the name of the Swap Party on the Swap Contract is often the same as the name of the Company’s Lender. What isn’t clear to the Company is that even if the name of the Swap Party is the same as the name of its Lender, the Swap Contract and the Loan come from two separate parts of the Lender’s organization, or two separate subsidiaries, with different decision makers and different, even conflicting, business goals. While the lending officer may benefit by adjusting the terms of the Company’s loan in response to a short-term change in business conditions, or may have an interest in continuing the Company as a customer of the bank, the division of the Lender that entered into the Swap Agreement has only one interest: having the Company follow the payment terms of the Swap Contract over its lifetime, or collecting the penalty the Company will be charged for an early termination.</p>\n<h2><strong>What's the Risk of Loss for the Borrower?</strong></h2>\n<p>The term of the Swap Contract between the Swap Party and the Company is as long as the loan itself—five to 10 years—or whatever term is specified in the loan agreement. The risk to the Company entering a Swap Contract is that during the long five- to 10-year life of the contract, a change in the Company’s financial circumstances, an unplanned business opportunity, or a change in the financial or political circumstances of the Lender, will cause the Company to terminate the Swap Contract before the end of its term. This is when the Company faces unexpected prepayment and penalty issues.</p>\n<p>Below are actual incidents from my practice where my clients were forced to prepay the Swap Contracts and pay an unexpected early termination penalty.</p>\n<ol>\n<li >A client’s manufacturing company (Manufacturer) pledged all of its real estate, inventory and receivables <span>to support its $12 million in bank loans. The real estate portion of the loan was $6 million and that </span><span>loan was coupled with a Swap. Four years later, the Manufacturer was presented with an opportunity to </span><span>purchase one of its key suppliers and thereby reduce its overall production costs. But to make this </span><span>purchase, an additional $4 million in new financing was required. The Manufacturer’s original Lender </span><span>turned down the Manufacturer’s request for additional financing but the Manufacturer found a new lender </span><span>who offered to provide the $4 million in new financing to purchase the acquisition, but wanted a lien on </span><span>receivables. Since the receivables were part of the asset package provided to the first Lender, the </span><span>Manufacturer had to repay all of its existing financing in order to provide a lien on its receivables requested </span><span>by the new lender. Therefore, the Manufacturer had to pay off its $12 million loan with its original Lender </span><span>and enter into a $16 million loan with the new Lender. This repayment of the first lender’s real estate loan </span><span>prior to its maturity date, automatically caused a premature termination of the Swap Contract, and my </span><span>client was forced to pay the Swap Party an early termination penalty of $650,000 before his company </span><span>could accept new financing.</span></li>\n<li ><span>The owner of a suburban shopping center received a favorable offer to purchase the center. The lender to </span><span>the shopping center had agreed that if its loan was repaid before maturity as a result of the sale of the </span><span>shopping center, the lender would not impose a prepayment penalty. However, the shopping center owner </span><span>had also signed a Swap Contract, and the lender's agreement not to impose a penalty did not include the </span><span>Swap Contract, and when the sale closed, my client had to pay $1.2 million as a Swap prepayment </span><span>penalty.</span></li>\n<li ><span>My client, a used car dealer, had done business with a small local bank for more than five years when the </span><span>bank was purchased by a much larger regional bank. The regional bank decided that they didn’t want to be </span><span>in the business of lending to used car dealers and that my client was no longer a desirable customer. The </span><span>lender began to pressure the car dealer to find another bank by interpreting the dealer’s company’s loan </span><span>documents more harshly and shrinking the dealer’s line of credit. The dealer soon “got the message” and </span><span>found another bank to take on his lending relationship. However, even though the bank wanted the dealer </span><span>to take his banking relationship to another bank, this didn’t affect the dealer’s Swap contract, and the </span><span>dealer unfortunately was charged an early termination Swap penalty of $250,000 when he changed </span><span>banks.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Frequently, a bank’s loan officers may be willing to try to work out loan issues with a Company, even if the Company misses a payment. However, the failure to make any payment under the Swap Contract, or the existence of a default under the Company’s loan agreement, will immediately be a default under the Swap Agreement, causing the Swap Agreement to terminate and the termination penalty to be assessed against the Company. So when a Company experiences financial problems, having a Swap makes those problems even worse.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Swap Agreement Termination Penalty: How Is It Calculated? </strong></h2>\n<p>Early termination of a Swap Contract is quite common. The penalty that the Company must pay in order to terminate the Swap Contract early is set out (but not easily understood) in the Swap Contract. An approximation of the termination cost is usually equal to the financial benefit that would have been earned by the Swap Partner over the remaining unexpired term of the Swap Contract, plus a break-up fee that can only be calculated by the Swap Party.</p>\n<p>An illustration of the financial benefit component of the swap termination penalty would be:</p>\n<h4 >Assume a Company enters into a 10-year 6% fixed interest rate Swap Contract for a $5 million loan. Six years into the Swap Contract the Company wants to terminate the Swap Contract, at a time when the current variable interest rate on the loan is 4.5%. The approximate termination fee would be calculated as: fixed rate of interest (6%) – current variable rate (4.5%) = 1.5% x unexpired term of the Swap Contract (four years) x outstanding balance of the loan ($5 million) = $300,000 penalty!</h4>\n<p>Assuming that you are the borrower, when the termination penalty is being explained to you by your loan officer, he or she often emphasizes that the termination penalty is a two-way street and either party may terminate the Swap Contract early. The loan officer gives you the mistaken impression that you could just as likely benefit from the early termination penalty as the Swap Party. However, the only circumstance under which you would benefit from an early termination of the Swap would be if the Swap Party is losing money on the Swap Contract, which is a once-in-a blue-moon circumstance.</p>\n<h2><strong>A Final Word of Advice</strong></h2>\n<p>If your lender suggests a Swap Contract, my advice is to follow the Nancy Reagan approach: “Just say no!” If your Company is not in a position to say “no” to your Lender, then take the shortest Swap Term offered. Very often your lender will offer you the choice of a five-, seven-, or 10-year Swap, with the fixed interest rate lower with each longer period of time. <strong>Always take the shortest Swap Term offered.</strong> The longer the Swap, the more likely you are to encounter an unforeseen circumstance that will cause you to prepay your loan and trigger a substantial penalty for the early termination of the Swap Contract.</p>\n<p><strong>Judith Fellheimer</strong> is a partner in the Business Litigation and Financial Services Practice Groups at the law firm of <a href=\"http://www.fellheimer.net\" title=\"Fellheimer &amp; Eichen LLP\">Fellheimer &amp; Eichen LLP</a>.</p>\n<p>Used with permission.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Sexual misconduct with minors is the primary reason churches end up in court.</p>\n<p>Although it is grievous to church leaders to receive allegations of such behavior within their church, the manner in which they respond can determine whether or not a lawsuit will be filed. If you receive an allegation, do you know what to do? </p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3><strong>Suggested Allegation Response Plan for Churches:</strong></h3>\n<p></p>\n<ol>\n<li ><span><strong>Understand your state mandatory reporting law</strong> and what constitutes the definition of sexual abuse and misconduct. Most clergy are mandatory reporters of child abuse.</span></li>\n<li ><strong>Report the allegation</strong> to the proper authorities as required by your state.</li>\n<li ><span><strong>Notify your insurance</strong> company immediately upon knowledge of an incident. Do not wait until a lawsuit is filed.</span></li>\n<li ><strong>Be aware of what is included in minutes</strong> during board meetings regarding the allegation. Information may be admissible as evidence in the event of a lawsuit.</li>\n<li ><strong>Take the matter seriously</strong> and address it promptly with the alleged victim and their family as well as the alleged perpetrator. </li>\n<li ><strong>Suspend the alleged perpetrator</strong>, pending investigation into the matter. It is crucial to stop this person's contact with minors, even if the allegation turns out to be false.</li>\n<li ><strong>Document the allegation</strong> and preserve evidence like the application, background check results, and reference checks. Obtain a written account of what happened. If the perpetrator admits to guilt, have a confession already prepared for them to sign. It should include consent for the senior pastor to release the information. </li>\n<li ><strong>Respond compassionately</strong> to the victim and their family. Never deny or minimize the seriousness of the matter, and never blame or make the victim feel it is their fault. Instead, offer support and professional assistance, such as counseling. Most people dislike the idea of suing their church, but how they are treated will decide whether or not they do. Doing the right thing by treating them with compassion has the collateral benefit of helping protect your church. </li>\n<li ><strong>Regarding adolescent perpetrators</strong>, follow these recommendations but realize the adolescent's behavior may be a symptom of their own victimization. If you know of an adolescent in your church who is a victim of abuse, carefully supervise their interaction with younger minors. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Most cases (77%) of child molestation not perpetrated by family members <strong>happen in restrooms</strong>. As a best practice, install cameras in Sunday school rooms and right outside restrooms. This helps protect the innocent if something is wrongfully alleged, and it gives documented evidence with which to respond to allegations.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<p>W<span>atch the full Risk Management LIVE discussion on handling allegations, including how to <strong>deal with the press</strong>.</span></p>\n<div> </div>\n<p>Sexual misconduct and child molestation is too serious a risk to ignore.

    "excerpt": "Take this important step before you share your church facilities with an outside group",
    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Take this important step before you share your church facilities with an outside group</p>\n<p>One thing many churches don’t think about is their potential liability when they allow outside groups or other churches to use their facilities. Some churches may have a martial arts group, boy scouts, a daycare, or a separate church plant using the building. If someone from the group gets hurt on their premises, the church could be held responsible as the owner of the property. In addition to exposing the church to legal liability, such accidents can increase the church's insurance premiums. The good news is you can minimize church liability through a facilities use agreement.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3><strong>What Is a Facilities Use Agreement?</strong></h3>\n<p>A facilities use agreement helps shield your church from liability while still allowing you to offer a space for outside groups to meet. In it, you can set forth the terms for how the group will use your premises, specifying that they will be left in good condition and surrendered back to the church. You can also include language stating the group will hold your church harmless and indemnify it. \"Indemnify\" means the group agrees to pay your church back if you have to pay any kind of damages because of an incident.</p>\n<h3><strong>What about Insurance?</strong></h3>\n<p>It is best for any group using your facility to have insurance. Your facilities use agreement should include an insurance clause in the language. When the group has insurance, protecting your church is simple. Just ask them to name your church on their general liability policy as an <strong>additional insured</strong> and provide you with a certificate of insurance showing your church has been added. This transfers primary responsibility onto their insurance, rather than the church's.</p>\n<p>Many churches allow church plants to meet in their facilities. As a best practice, the church plant should have their own insurance and sign a facilities use agreement. A basic general liability insurance policy is not expensive, but it provides crucial protection both for the church plant and the church that owns the building.</p>\n<h3><strong>What about Weddings or Other One-Time Events?</strong></h3>\n<p>If the event is for a group, require a signed facilities use agreement and certificate of insurance. If it is an individual's wedding or something for a member of the congregation, a facilities use agreement is not needed. In general, risk should be evaluated in light of the type of activity, the number of people involved, and whether the group is made up of children or elderly people.</p>\n<h3><strong>Sample Facilities Use Agreement Form</strong></h3>\n<p>Next time you open your facilities to an outside group, make sure you are protected by downloading this sample <a title=\"Facilities Use Agreement Form\" href=\"https://media.agfinancial.org/insurance-facilitiesuseagreement.pdf\">Facilities Use Agreement Form</a>.*</p>\n<p>To learn more about ways to reduce church risk, call our risk management team at 866.621.1787 or email me at <a title=\"jsparks@agfinancial.org\" href=\"mailto:jsparks@agfinancial.org\">jsparks@agfinancial.org</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Does your church allow outside groups to use your facilities?

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>The decisions and operations of a church board may expose board members to personal liability and even lawsuit. Take these steps to help protect your board.</p>\n<p>1. Understand your state's charitable immunity laws. </p>\n<p>Some states provide charitable immunity for volunteers, which may include church board members. The purpose of this law is to encourage them to serve by reducing liability exposure. Check to see if your state provides charitable immunity and whether its definition of \"volunteer\" covers church boards.</p>\n<p>2. Avoid gross negligence.</p>\n<p>In most states, charitable immunity laws do not protect against gross negligence, defined as any act or omission that is intentional, willfully negligent, or committed with disregard or indifference towards the safety of others. At one church, the board members were personally sued because of an incident that occurred at the church between a minor and an adult known to be a past sexual offender. The plaintiff alleged that the church board failed to provide and enforce a sex offender policy after knowing the offender attended the church—a failure that amounted to gross negligence.</p>\n<p>3. Incorporate your church.</p>\n<p>Maintaining a corporate status with your state has the benefit of providing personal liability protection for your board members and other church leaders. Check with your Secretary of State's office for information on becoming incorporated and to update your status annually, or as required.</p>\n<p>4. Follow your own rules.</p>\n<p>Church bylaws can provide crucial legal protection, as long as you operate by them. If there is a legal dispute, a court may look to the rules established in the bylaws for guidance. In addition, the bylaws should include provisions that indemnify (protect) board members from personal liability for board decisions. An attorney can assist you in amending the language if needed.</p>\n<p>5. Obtain directors, officers, and trustees (DOT) insurance.</p>\n<p><span>If someone brings legal action against a board member, defense costs could be steep. In addition to paying for claims that may arise, DOT insurance covers the cost of legal fees.</span></p>\n<p>Following these five practices can greatly reduce liability for your board members so they can focus on serving.</p>\n<p><span>Get more tips like these in the free church finance guide below. </span></p>\n<p><span>For more information about church liability and insurance coverage, call 866.621.1787or email me at <a title=\"jsparks@agfinancial.org\" href=\"mailto: jsparks@agfinancial.org\">jsparks@agfinancial.org</a>. </span></p>\n<p><em>This article does not constitute legal advice and is not a substitute for obtaining professional legal counsel.</em></p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

The ruling was in response to a lawsuit brought by the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) challenging the constitutionality of the housing allowance and the parsonage exclusion.</p>\n<p>Here are five things to note about this ruling.</p>\n<p>First, the ministerial housing allowance is set forth in section 107(2) of the federal tax code. This section exempts from federal income taxation that portion of a minister’s compensation that is designated in advance by an employing church as a housing allowance to the extent that it is used for housing expenses and does not exceed the home’s fair rental value. Section 107(1) exempts from income taxation the rental value of a parsonage provided by a church to a minister as compensation for ministerial services. While FFRF challenged the constitutionality of both sections, it ultimately narrowed its challenge to section 107(2), meaning that the parsonage exclusion remains intact, at least for now.</p>\n<p>Second, the court concluded that the housing allowance under section 107(2) is an unconstitutional preference for religion since the same benefit is not provided to other taxpayers. The court relied on a 1989 decision by the United States Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that a Texas statute exempting from the state sales tax periodicals and books “published or distributed by a religious faith” was an unconstitutional preference for religion. The Supreme Court concluded that tax exemptions that include religious organizations “must have an overarching secular purpose that equally benefits similarly situated nonreligious organizations.” To illustrate, the exemption of church property from taxation is constitutionally permissible because state laws exempt a wide range of non-religious properties from taxation. In contrast, the housing allowance applies only to ministers.</p>\n<p>The Wisconsin court conceded that there are other provisions in the tax code that recognize housing allowances, and it referred specifically to state department employees and the military. But, “it is not enough to point to a small number of secular groups that could receive a similar exemption for a different reason.”</p>\n<p>Third, the court enjoined the IRS and Department of the Treasury from enforcing section 107(2). But it added that its ruling “shall take effect at the conclusion of any appeals . . . or the expiration of the deadline for filing an appeal, whichever is later.” An appeal by the IRS and Department of the Treasury would be to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, and could take up to a year to resolve.</p>\n<p>Fourth, a ruling by a federal district court judge in Wisconsin is not binding on other courts, and does not apply to minsters in other states. If the ruling is appealed and affirmed by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, it will apply to ministers in that circuit (Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin). It would become a national precedent binding on ministers in all states only if affirmed by the United States Supreme Court (an unlikely outcome). As a result, churches should continue to designate housing allowances for ministerial employees for 2014, and church pension plans should continue to designate housing allowances for retired ministers. Such allowances will continue to be valid in all states outside of the Seventh Circuit (Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin), and to ministers in the Seventh Circuit so long as the district court’s ruling is reversed on appeal, or the appeals court does not render an opinion in 2014. However, if the appeals court affirms the district court’s decision in 2014, or if no appeal is pursued, then a housing allowance for ministers in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin may be partially or wholly lost. Ministers in these states should address the continuing availability of the housing allowance with a tax professional.</p>\n<p>Fifth, the financial impact of this ruling will be significant, especially for ministers who purchased homes in reliance on the continuing availability of the housing allowance. This impact would be mitigated if Congress eliminates the treatment of ministers as self-employed for Social Security. Most ministers are employees for income tax reporting, but the tax code treats all of them as self-employed for Social Security. This is sometimes referred to as the “dual tax status” of ministers. The financial impact can be significant, since self-employed persons pay the “self-employment tax” which is 15.3 percent of net earnings, while employees and employers split the Social Security and Medicare (FICA) tax rate of 15.3 percent, with each paying 7.65 percent. There is little Congress can do to overturn a federal district court’s interpretation of the Constitution, but it can materially reduce the financial impact of the district court’s ruling on ministers, which in many cases will be substantial, by revoking their mandatory self-employed status for Social Security.</p>\n<p>Dr. Richard Hammar</p>\n<p>Legal Counsel, The General Council of the Assemblies of God</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>The beginning of each new year is a great time for churches to set goals for reducing and managing risk. A crucial step in the process involves taking time to review and assess all church policies to uncover areas of risk and discover ways to improve. Use these guidelines to conduct a thorough policy checkup.</p>\n<h2><strong>Risk Management Policies</strong></h2>\n<p>Policies to review and implement, if you haven’t already, include the following:</p>\n<h3>Abuse prevention for minors</h3>\n<p>The number one reason churches end up in court is sexual misconduct. Because of this unfortunate fact, it’s absolutely crucial to perform <strong>background checks</strong> on all staff and volunteers who work with minors—no matter how long they’ve been with your church. In addition, require and check two personal references for each person. Maintain a <strong>two-adult rule</strong>: no child should ever be alone with just one adult. Finally, make plans to conduct regular training on abuse prevention/response for all staff and volunteers.</p>\n<h3>Cell phones</h3>\n<p>All church employees, including the pastor and staff, should be required to sign a written agreement prohibiting the use of hand-held cell phones and other devices <strong>while driving</strong> for church business and while driving church-owned or rented vehicles.</p>\n<h3>Social media</h3>\n<p>A good policy will require documenting current and intended social media use, implementation of safeguards such as disclaimers and confidentiality protection measures, employee training, and monitoring of all church and church employee social media use.</p>\n<h3>Emergency Response</h3>\n<p>Implement (or fortify) a church security/safety team. This team will formulate emergency action plans, train staff and volunteers how to carry out the plans, monitor premises, and more. Local law enforcement can be a great source of help to your security team.</p>\n<h3>Transportation</h3>\n<p>Accidents can be the result of unsafe vehicles, poor driving conditions, distracted drivers, and a lack of training. Develop pre- and post-trip vehicle inspection checklists, and make sure all drivers complete the checklists. Ensure that all vehicles are regularly maintained. Finally, consider requiring all drivers to attend a defensive driving course every few years. Many insurance companies will provide online defensive driver training.</p>\n<h2><strong>Insurance Policies</strong></h2>\n<p>Review all church property and general liability insurance policies. Many churches do not understand the types or amounts of coverage they have. Call your agent and ask for a policy review. They will be able to clearly explain what is covered and what is not.</p>\n<p>By conducting regular policy checkups, you can greatly improve the safety and security of everyone in your church. If you have questions or would like more information, feel free to contact one of our certified risk managers at <strong>866.662.8210</strong> or email <a href=\"mailto:info@agfinancialinsurance.org\">info@agfinancialinsurance.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Estate planning is an essential task but can feel overwhelming. Use this list of seven questions as a basic guide to help simplify the process. Although you can take some steps yourself, it is recommended that you seek the services of an attorney who will be able to draw up and file legal documents in accordance with state law and answer your questions. Note: everything mentioned here is optional and may or may not apply to your specific needs and wishes.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>1. Have I planned for joint ownership?</strong><strong><br />\n</strong>This is one of the first questions you should ask regarding any asset you own, including your home, vehicles, and various accounts. When an asset is held jointly, upon the death of one of the named owners, the asset passes to the survivor free of probate (see definition below).</p>\n<p><em>Terms to Know</em><strong><br />\n</strong><strong>Decedent</strong>:<em> </em>A person who has died.<br />\n<strong>Estate: </strong>Property and assets belonging to the decedent.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Have I designated beneficiaries for all my assets?<br />\n</strong>When you name a beneficiary for an asset, it transfers upon your death (free of probate) to the named person, provided you complete a beneficiary designation form, also known as a \"payable on death\" designation. Many types of accounts allow this, including investment accounts, IRAs, other retirement accounts, and life insurance policies.</p>\n<p><em>Terms to Know</em><strong><br />\n</strong><strong>Beneficiary</strong>:<strong> </strong>A person designated to receive something according to the terms of a will or trust.<br />\n<strong>Probate</strong>:<em> </em>A court procedure for settling the personal and business affairs of a decedent by proving that his or her will is valid and establishing the legal transfer of property to any named beneficiaries. If there is no valid will or trust, an administrator will be appointed by the state to supervise the legal transfer of property to heirs.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Have I considered establishing a living trust?<br />\n</strong>A living trust is a legal document similar to a will but with the advantage of allowing your estate to pass to beneficiaries privately, without expensive court proceedings or probate delays. It also allows you to instruct a chosen trustee how you want all assets in the trust managed during your lifetime in the event of illness or incapacity.</p>\n<p><em>Terms to Know</em><strong><br />\n</strong><strong>Grantor/Trustor</strong><em>: </em>The person placing cash, real estate, etc., into a trust.<br />\n<strong>Trustee</strong><em>: </em>The person or legal entity who receives property and places it in a trust, and manages the trust for the benefit of the beneficiary(ies) in ways consistent with the trust declaration and good business practice.<br />\n<strong>Corpus of a trust</strong><em>: </em>The body of assets placed in a trust. The trust holds title to all property included in the corpus.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Have I made a will?<br />\n</strong>This is the most basic step everyone should take, even if you have a small estate. Any assets you have which are not designated to transfer to survivors because of joint ownership, beneficiary designations, or a trust usually must pass through probate. At that point, a will lets you control how those assets are distributed. Every state creates a “state-written will” for those who have not made their own. The laws vary from state to state, but if you neglect to make a will, there is no guarantee your wishes will be met.</p>\n<p><em>Terms to Know</em><strong><br />\n</strong><strong>Testator</strong><em>: </em>The person who makes a will; one who dies leaving a will.<br />\n<strong>Executor</strong><em>: </em>The business manager of your estate designated in your will to manage and carry out the instructions, the payments of debts, the distribution of property, and to settle accounts according to the will.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Have I completed a financial durable power of attorney form?<br />\n</strong>A durable power of attorney takes effect if you can no longer handle your financial affairs because of illness, sickness, or incompetence. The form allows you to designate a person who will be legally authorized to manage your financial affairs.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Have I completed a medical durable power of attorney form?<br />\n</strong>This form lets you appoint someone to help with personal matters, such as health care, medical attention, or personal care in the event you become unable to take care of yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Have I completed a living will?<br />\n</strong>If you suffer an incurable injury, illness, or terminal disease where medical life-sustaining measures would only prolong your death and keep you alive at great expense to your family, a living will states that you would not want these measures taken.</p>\n<p>Answering these questions will take you far down the road in planning your estate.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>With so much media attention focused on shootings in public places, you may be wondering whether your church could be found legally liable if a shooting takes place there. A recent Virginia State Supreme Court ruling on the Virginia Tech University shooting case could set the precedent.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>The Virginia Tech shooting took place in April of 2007 when an armed assailant killed 32 people and injured many more. A lawsuit was brought by the families of two victims, and the court found the university to be liable for the shooting. It awarded $4 million to each family. The university appealed the ruling to the Virginia State Supreme Court, which ruled that the university was not liable. The reason? It was not <strong>foreseeable</strong> for them to have anticipated the shooting.</p>\n<p>If you think you must take extensive precautions to protect against an armed shooting because you fear your church will be liable if you don’t, it's important to realize that liability is based on how foreseeable the incident was.</p>\n<h2>How is foreseeability decided?</h2>\n<p>As in the Virginia Tech case, a court would use the following four questions to evaluate foreseeability if a shooting were to take place on your property:</p>\n<ol>\n<li >Did criminal conduct occur on or near your property (within a one-block radius)?</li>\n<li >How recently did the criminal conduct occur?</li>\n<li >How similar was that criminal conduct to the shooting that occurred on your premises?</li>\n<li >What publicity was given to those previous criminal acts so that you knew about them?<span> </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Even if a shooting could be considered foreseeable, many courts have said it’s nearly impossible to prevent these kinds of crimes. Historically, dedicated armed assailants are able to overcome protective measures, including metal detectors and armed police officers. In fact, Virginia Tech had its own police force on campus when the shooting occurred, but that did not prevent the incident.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> If a shooting happens on your premises, it’s unlikely your church will be found legally liable for injuries or deaths that occur.</p>\n<h2>I want to protect my church. What can I do?</h2>\n<p>Ironically, while most churches rightly desire to protect their congregations, taking steps to increase security can actually <strong>raise </strong>your liability. This often happens when a church uses unqualified people to provide security. For that reason, it’s not a good idea to have a security team that is allowed to carry concealed weapons on your premises without a vetting process. If an armed assailant gets multiple guns fired at him, innocent bystanders could easily be killed or injured—a scenario that poses significant legal risk to the church.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow these best practices to protect your congregation and reduce church liability:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get law enforcement involved when you’re first developing a security team and safety policy so efforts can be coordinated with them.</li>\n<li>Hire local uniformed police officers to be your security during services. When they respond to an emergency, they cease to be an agent of the church and become a public officer, <strong>removing your church’s liability</strong>.</li>\n<li><span>If you allow security team members to carry concealed weapons, develop a careful vetting process.</span></li>\n<li><span>Require all carriers to be Concealed Carry Weapons (CCW) certified.</span></li>\n<li><span>If you refuse someone the privilege of carrying a gun on church premises, document the reason.</span></li>\n<li><span>All weapons should be transported inconspicuously, not to be displayed outside of critical, life-endangering incidents.</span></li>\n<li><span>Have the weapon case or holster inspected by the security team leader before being put into service for the first time.</span></li>\n<li><span>Require that the weapon remain on the person at all times.</span></li>\n<li><span>Require preparations and handling of weapons to be done before the holders come onto church premises.</span></li>\n<li><span>Have your security team undergo training that meet or exceeds law enforcement standards in your area.</span></li>\n<li><span>Document all training with participants' names, the date, description of training, and signatures for your records.</span></li>\n<li><span>Require identification to be worn by team members before a weapon is drawn. Inform local law enforcement of the means of identification in writing and ask for confirmation that they acknowledge your policy and identification.</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Providing a safe, loving environment where children can learn about Jesus is one of the highest callings and privileges of churches. The last thing we want is for a child and their family to be hurt. However, some churches may unknowingly put kids’ safety at risk by not following recommended precautionary steps in selecting volunteers and staff. For example, criminal background checks, while essential, are not enough.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>A useful question to help guide your church safety policies is this: <strong>H</strong><strong>ow can we demonstrate to a jury that reasonable care was taken to protect children?</strong></p>\n<p>Hopefully, your church will never have to answer that question for an actual jury due to a child sexual misconduct or abuse allegation, but the following list has been developed with it in mind. Your selection process should include <strong>every single one</strong> of these steps.</p>\n<h2>6 Steps to Follow</h2>\n<ol>\n<li >A <strong>written application</strong> for all employees and every person working with minors, as well as anyone with a key to the church.</li>\n<li >A thorough <strong>interview</strong> process.</li>\n<li >A <strong>background check</strong>, including a criminal record check and sexual offender registry check.</li>\n<li >Two documented <strong>reference checks</strong>, including any past church history.</li>\n<li >A <strong>two-adult policy</strong>. At no time should a child be left alone with an adult.</li>\n<li >A <strong>six-month rule</strong>. All applicants must be in good standing with the church for at least six months before being allowed to work with minors.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Case Study</h2>\n<p>Recently, the Florida Baptist Convention was sued because of inappropriate sexual behavior involving minors perpetrated by a minister at a church plant. Although a criminal background check had been done and had come up clean, the Convention had not checked with the minister's previous places of ministry. If they had, they might have discovered the fact that he had been accused of inappropriate behavior at two churches in Maryland and Alabama. Those churches had not reported the behavior to the authorities but chose to simply dismiss him, which was why the background check revealed nothing. However, the court determined that the Convention was liable because they should have checked with those churches to obtain references. In simply making the effort to check, the Convention may have been able to demonstrate to the court that reasonable care had been taken. The court decided their failure to get references amounted to negligent selection. As a result, not only were children hurt, but also the Convention is now facing $12.5 million in damages.</p>\n<h2 >Selection Process for Minors Who Want to Work with Children</h2>\n<p>While background checks cannot be obtained for those under 18 years of age, it’s a common church practice to use teenagers as children’s workers. However, you still need to exercise reasonable care in selecting adolescent workers. You can do that by requiring two or three <strong>reference letters</strong> from people who can give an opinion as to their suitability for working with children.</p>\n<p>In addition, it is recommended that you contact other local youth-serving charities such as the Boy or Girl Scouts, YMCA, as well as public schools to ask about the screening process they use for minors. Document your contact with each organization and <strong>align your process</strong> with theirs when applicable.</p>\n<p>Finally, if you decide to use adolescent workers, ensure <strong>adult supervision</strong> of them at all times during activities involving minors.</p>\n<p>You want to do everything you can to protect children, their families, and your church. The best practices given here will help you do that.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>In 2012, there were 3.5 million reports of child abuse in the U.S. Collectively, the reports involved <strong>6 million children</strong>. Although churches have a tremendous opportunity to protect and nurture innocent lives, many church leaders remain confused about their responsibility to report alleged incidents. Not reporting abuse can lead to a child’s unnecessary continued suffering. Several factors contribute to the problem:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ignorance of the law. As laws change, it can feel overwhelming to sift through new information.</li>\n<li>Fear of being sued for unintentionally filing a false report when you are not absolutely certain the abuse occurred. Limited immunity from liability usually protects reporters, as we’ll discuss later.</li>\n<li>Reporting the abuse to someone else at church, perhaps the senior pastor, rather than reporting it to the authorities. For mandatory reporters, this doesn't go far enough in most states.</li>\n<li>Fear one’s identity will be revealed. When you report abuse to your state hotline, you are assured of anonymity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 ><strong><br />\nHere are answers to some of the most common questions church leaders ask:</strong></h3>\n<p><em><strong>Do all states require child abuse reporting?</strong></em><br />\nAll states require child abuse reporting from mandatory reporters. Many people mistakenly think you must have actual knowledge of abuse in order to report. Having<strong> reasonable suspicion </strong>of abuse is enough reason to report.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Who is a mandatory reporter?</em><br />\n</strong>In addition to doctors, teachers, and childcare workers, many states now consider <strong>everyone </strong>a mandatory reporter. It is imperative to know whether or not you are a mandatory reporter in your state.</p>\n<p>Learn your state’s requirements at <a href=\"http://www.childwelfare.gov\">www.childwelfare.gov</a>.<br />\nFor ministers: <a href=\"https://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/clergymandated.cfm\">Clergy as Mandatory Reporters of Child Abuse and Neglect</a>.<br />\nFor all other individuals: <a href=\"https://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/manda.cfm\">Mandatory Reporters of Child Abuse and Neglect</a>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>What is reportable child abuse?</strong></em><br />\nReportable child abuse includes sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect. Neglect is the most common type of abuse, involved in almost 80% of reports.</p>\n<p><em><strong>What is the impact of state child abuse reporting laws on ministers?</strong></em><br />\nMinisters often receive information about child abuse because of their roles as spiritual advisors. Because of their exposure to such information, it’s essential for ministers to understand their<strong> child abuse reporting duties</strong> under state law. It may be tempting to treat the abuse as an internal matter of church discipline. However, that response is not enough if you are a mandatory reporter. Depending on the state, mandatory reporters may also include church staff and volunteers. If so, simply reporting child abuse to the senior pastor of the church<strong> does not relieve these individuals</strong> of their duty to report. A few states will allow a church to designate a staff member, such as the lead pastor, to whom abuse can be reported in lieu of calling the hotline. In most states, however, this does not relieve a mandatory reporter of the duty to report to the state.</p>\n<p><em><strong>How does the clergy-penitent privilege apply?</strong></em><br />\nThirty-two states have enacted laws excusing clergy from the duty to report information obtained in the course of a privileged conversation between the minister and an individual seeking spiritual advice. In these states, ministers would not be required by law to report child abuse, even if they are a mandatory reporter. But caution must be exercised. First, make sure you thoroughly understand your state's clergy-penitent privilege statute. You may need to seek legal advice to know if the statute applies to the situation. Second, even if the privilege excuses you from reporting, consider the sleep test. It’s simple: Will you be able to sleep at night if you don't report the abuse?</p>\n<p><em><strong>How do I report child abuse?</strong></em><br />\nCall the child abuse hotline in your state. <a href=\"https://www.childhelp.org/hotline/\">Find your state’s hotline here</a>.</p>\n<p>Several states also allow individuals to report child abuse to a law enforcement officer directly.</p>\n<p><em><strong>What are the risks of not reporting?</strong></em><br />\nIf you are a mandatory reporter, failing to report child abuse will expose you to a criminal penalty (usually a misdemeanor) under state law. In some states, mandatory child abuse reporters are also subject to civil liability for failing to report.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that every state supplies mandatory reporters with <em>limited liability immunity</em> if the abuse report is never substantiated. This protects you from being sued for a report made in good faith, even if the allegations were false.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to Respond to Allegations of Child Abuse</strong></h3>\n<p>When presented with information about potential child abuse, answering the following questions will help you respond properly, as you strive to protect the victim, your church, and yourself:</p>\n<ol>\n<li >Am I a mandatory or permissive reporter under state law? <a title=\"Find out here\" href=\"https://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/manda.cfm\" target=\"_self\">Find out here</a>.</li>\n<li >Do the allegations constitute child abuse as defined under state law?</li>\n<li >Do I have reasonable cause to believe abuse has occurred?</li>\n<li >Does the clergy-penitent privilege protect me from disclosing this information?</li>\n<li >Did the alleged abuse involve pedophilic behavior (sexual contact with a pre-adolescent child)?</li>\n<li >Do I have any risk of civil liability under state law if I choose not to report the abuse?</li>\n<li >Should I discuss the available evidence with the state agency that receives child abuse reports to determine whether the agency believes that a report should be filed?</li>\n<li >Should I try to persuade the informant to report the abuse?</li>\n<li >Can child abuse be reported to law enforcement officials in my state?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more information about church liability and additional ways to reduce church risk, call AGFinancial Insurance Solutions at <strong>866.662.8210</strong>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Life insurance is not for you—it's for your family.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Providing a life insurance policy is one of the simplest and best ways to protect and care for your loved ones. A good policy provides enough to cover final expenses, pay off debts, and perhaps even invest for the future, an important consideration for those with young children.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when times are tough and money is tight, obtaining proper life insurance may not be a priority. Many people wait to purchase until after something happens to cause them concern, such as an unexpected health incident. At that point, it can be nearly impossible to purchase life insurance, and even if it is available, it will often cost much more. For that reason, it is recommended to obtain coverage as early as possible, to qualify for the best rates.</p>\n<p>If you’ve been putting off getting life insurance, now is the time to take action. The process is not as complicated as you may think. Here are the steps you’ll need to follow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li ><strong>Speak with an agent.</strong> Licensed professional insurance agents will guide you in the type of policy you should purchase and help determine the right amount for your financial circumstances, as well as your family’s needs. In determining whether you need term or permanent life insurance, your agent will ask several questions. For example, are you looking for coverage for final expenses, debt protection, your children’s future needs, etc.? Do you want to replace your income for a few years to cover expenses so your surviving spouse has time to grieve without having to worry about ongoing bills? To help you decide the right coverage amount for your needs, try one of our <a href=\"/insurance/calculators/\">insurance calculators</a>.</li>\n<li ><strong>Request a quote.</strong> When comparing quotes, make sure you compare the same benefits including coverage amount, type of policy, rating of the company, and any additional coverages. It’s best to work with a provider who will shop various companies to search out the best price on your behalf. <a title=\"Request a life insurance quote from AGFinancial Insurance Solutions\" href=\"/insurance/request-a-quote/individual-life/\" target=\"_self\">Request a life insurance quote from AGFinancial Insurance Solutions</a>.</li>\n<li ><strong>Apply for coverage by completing an insurance application.</strong> The application will ask you for personal information regarding financial and health history. This information will be compared to what is given at the time of a medical exam, the next step in the process.</li>\n<li ><strong>Complete the medical exam.</strong> Most insurance carriers will pay for you to be examined by a health professional in order to confirm the information on the application and to have an accurate evaluation for the underwriter. The exam is usually done by an independent third party to assure unbiased evaluation and is commonly called a paramedical exam. It may take place in your home or office or at a medical facility.</li>\n<li ><strong>Be patient and wait.</strong> The insurance company will obtain your medical records, do a credit check, and review your application. Once the underwriter has reviewed the information, they will contact your agent to let them know whether the application is approved and at what rating. The rating is the class of risk you’re given based on your health data. For example, “preferred” would indicate lower risk, and “standard” would indicate a higher risk. The better your rating, the lower your premiums are likely to be.</li>\n<li ><strong>Accept or decline the policy.</strong> When the policy has been approved, it is now up to you to accept or reject it. If something showed up in your medical or financial history to increase the premium, you have the option to decline the policy.</li>\n<li ><strong>Final step: fund the policy.</strong> If you accept the policy, the final step in the process is to pay the premium. You’ll be sent a copy of the policy to keep. Once the insurance company receives the premium, your policy is in force. As long as the premiums are paid on time, the policy is yours for as long as the term you agreed to pay. If you decide to terminate the policy, a letter to the agent or insurance company asking for termination of coverage should be sufficient to cancel the policy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Taking time to plan for the unexpected now is not just a smart decision; it can also save your loved ones much unnecessary financial stress later.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Legal issues often follow close on the heels of technological advances. To keep up with ever-changing technology, state and federal laws continue to change.<br />\n</p>\n<h3><strong>Overview of laws as of October 31, 2013:</strong></h3>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>Handheld</strong> cell phone use while operating a vehicle has been prohibited in 12 states plus Washington D.C. Those states are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois (effective January 1, 2014), Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Washington, and West Virginia. Furthermore, these laws are classified as “primary enforcement,” which means someone can be ticketed for violating that law without any other traffic offense.</p>\n<p>Thirty-seven states plus Washington D.C. ban <strong>all use</strong> of cell phones by novice drivers—mainly adolescents.</p>\n<p><strong>Text messaging</strong> while driving is banned for drivers of all ages in 41 states plus Washington D.C. There are currently calls in Congress to enact federal legislation regarding text messaging while driving, which would apply to all states.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do these laws affect church liability?</strong></h3>\n<p>The following are four ways a church could potentially be found liable:</p>\n<ol>\n<li ><strong>Negligence.</strong> For example, while texting, a pastor causes an accident.</li>\n<li ><strong>Employer liability.</strong> As employers, churches carry responsibility for the negligent acts of employees committed during their duties, including driving for ministry purposes and church business.</li>\n<li ><strong>Negligence in violating a statute</strong> (negligence per se). For instance, if you injure or kill someone while violating an applicable statute, the negligence does not have to be proven.</li>\n<li ><strong>Gross negligence.</strong> This type of negligence is the failure to exercise even slight care and is much more serious than ordinary negligence. It can place a church and its individual board members at risk for lawsuit, which may include the payment of compensatory and punitive damages. Some examples of gross negligence could include the following: (a) failing to adopt a policy prohibiting cell phone use when driving, (b) failing to screen staff and volunteers who work with minors, (c) using 15-passenger vans without restriction, (d) using <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid92798crib-safety-deadline-for-child-care-facilities/\">non-compliant cribs</a> in the church nursery or daycare.</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p>\n<h3><strong>Recommendations</strong></h3>\n<p>Churches should adopt a written policy to address cell phone use for all church employees, including the pastoral staff, in accordance with state laws.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Download a sample church cell phone policy for employees here\" href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/cell-phone-policy/\">Download a sample church cell phone policy for employees here</a>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, continual education in staff meetings is recommended. Inform all employees of the legal risks of not following the policy. Consider a progressive discipline policy for its violation. For example, the first offense results in a reprimand, the second a week off without pay, and the third dismissal. In those states where there is already a statute regulating cell phone use, this discipline policy should be much tougher. For instance, after a first offense, an employee receives a week without pay and after a second offense, dismissal. If a church is not prepared to enforce its own policy, it could be deemed negligent in the event of a lawsuit.</p>\n<p>Church liability is a dynamic issue. Pastors and board members should keep tabs on state laws and adjust current church policies or develop new ones as needed.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>With the holiday season upon us, it’s easy to become distracted from important year-end tax and administrative responsibilities. In the video below, Dr. Richard Hammar, attorney, CPA, and legal counsel for the Assemblies of God, presents ten critical tasks that churches should address by year's end.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<ol>\n<li ><strong>Housing allowance.</strong> Every church board or congregation should designate a housing allowance for 2014 for ministers who own or rent their home (and for ministers who live in a parsonage and who pay some of their housing expenses). If you're a minister, you can figure out your specific housing expenses with the <a title=\"minister’s housing expenses worksheet\" href=\"/blog/ministers-housing-expenses-worksheet/\">minister’s housing expenses worksheet</a>. Be sure to consult your tax professional or financial advisor as you fill it out. Be aware that a federal court in Wisconsin has ruled that the housing allowance is an unconstitutional preference for religion. This case likely will be appealed, and if so, it may take a year or longer for a federal appeals court to review the case. The implementation of this case has been postponed pending the outcome of any appeal, so churches should continue to designate housing allowances for ministers with the understanding that this benefit eventually may be unavailable.</li>\n<li ><strong>W-4 forms.</strong> All employees should review their W-4 form and submit a new one if circumstances have changed to ensure accurate tax withholding for the coming year.</li>\n<li ><strong>Notice to donors.</strong> Donors should be advised not to file their 2013 federal income tax return before they receive their contribution summary from the church for 2013. Donors may not be able to deduct individual contributions of $250 or more if they file a tax return before receiving a contribution summary from their church.</li>\n<li ><strong>Christmas gifts.</strong> Be sure to correctly handle any Christmas gifts made by the church or congregation to a minister or lay staff member. In most cases, these transfers represent taxable income and not a tax-free gift, and must be reported as income on the recipient’s W-2 form.<br />\nA gift of property having a value so small as to make accounting for it unreasonable or administratively impracticable is a nontaxable “de minimis fringe benefit.” This exception does not apply to cash or cash equivalents (i.e. gift certificates).<br />\nGifts made to volunteers are subject to these same rules, except that a church is not required to report these gifts as taxable income to volunteers unless the volunteer receives compensation from the church of $600 or more during the year (in which case the church should issue them a Form 1099).</li>\n<li ><strong>Handling end-of-year contributions.</strong> The general rule is that a contribution is effective when delivered. This means a check submitted in the church offering in January of 2014 cannot be deducted in 2013 even if it is backdated to 2013. One exception—checks that are mailed <em>and postmarked</em> in 2013 are deductible in 2013 even if not received by the church until 2014.</li>\n<li ><strong>Business expenses.</strong> If your church reimburses some or all of your employees’ business expenses, reimburse year-end business expenses now. <em>Caution</em>: If you have an accountable reimbursement arrangement, distributing any balance in the reimbursement account to your employees at year-end may make all reimbursements for the year non-accountable.</li>\n<li ><strong>Reclassification of workers.</strong> Now is the time to decide if you want to reclassify any of your workers for tax reporting purposes. If you have a minister or lay worker who is treated as self-employed for federal income tax reporting purposes and you would like to reclassify the person as an employee, the ideal time to make the change is on January 1 of the new year.<br />\nMany churches incorrectly report ministers as employees for Social Security and withhold Social Security and Medicare taxes from their wages. This is incorrect, since the tax code classifies ministers as self-employed for Social Security with respect to services they perform in the exercise of ministry. As a result, they pay the self-employment tax, not Social Security and Medicare taxes. The ideal time to reclassify these ministers as self-employed for Social Security is January 1 of the new year. Consult with a tax professional about correcting any previous misclassification of ministers and lay employees for federal tax reporting purposes.</li>\n<li ><strong>Voluntary withholding.</strong> Ministers’ wages are exempt from Social Security, Medicare, and federal income tax withholding with respect to services performed in the exercise of their ministry. This means they use the quarterly estimated tax procedure to prepay their federal taxes. Ministers who report their income taxes as employees can enter into a <em>voluntary withholding arrangement</em> with their employing church by submitting a W-4 form to the church treasurer or business administrator. Under such an arrangement, the employing church withholds income taxes as it would for any other employee and also can withhold an additional amount of income taxes to cover the minister’s self-employment tax liability. The ideal time to start voluntary withholding is January 1.<br />\nSome churches have filed a Form 8274 with the IRS exempting themselves from the employer’s share of Social Security and Medicare taxes. Lay employees of such churches are treated as self-employed for making quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS, unless they request voluntary withholding. Under such an arrangement, the church withholds an additional amount of federal income taxes to cover their estimated self-employment tax liability.</li>\n<li ><strong>Order IRS tax forms and publications.</strong> December is a good time to order your 2014 copy of IRS Publication 15 (withholding tables), and copies of Forms W-2, W-3, 1099, and 1096 that you will be issuing for compensation paid in 2013. Other forms to reorder include W-4, W-9, and 8283. To order forms, simply call the IRS toll-free number 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676). You can also download most forms directly from <a title=\"www.irs.gov\" href=\"http://www.irs.gov\">www.irs.gov</a>.</li>\n<li ><strong>Order tax publications and renew subscriptions.</strong> If you have not done so already, now is a good time to order the 2014 edition of Dr. Richard Hammar’s <em>Church and Clergy Tax Guide</em> to have for the coming year. To order, call 1-800-222-1840 or visit <a title=\"www.ChurchLawandTax.com\" href=\"http://www.churchlawandtax.com\">www.ChurchLawandTax.com</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Please note that AGFinancial is not a law firm and does not provide legal or tax advice.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>It’s in the best interest of first-time borrowers and those who haven’t borrowed in a while to shop for a church loan with their eyes and ears wide open. One way to do that is to ask potential lenders as many questions as possible. You’ve heard it said there are no wrong questions, but when it comes to finding the best church loan, some questions are definitely better than others.</p>\n<p><img id=\"img-1370617903748\" src=\"//cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/25853/file-61454627-png/images/church1.png\" alt=\"church loan\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>To guide you, we’ve compiled a list of 12 questions to ask lenders when shopping for a loan.</p>\n<ol>\n<li ><strong>Do you specialize in church loans?</strong><br />\nLocal banks and credit unions may not have expertise in church lending specifically. If they do not, you run the risk that your church will be seen as just another business transaction. A lender who specializes in church loans will see your church not as a business but as a ministry, with needs that deserve unique, flexible financing solutions.</li>\n<li ><strong>How much can I afford to borrow? </strong><br />\nKnowing what your project will cost is helpful, but it’s only half the equation. You also need to know how much debt your church can afford while still allowing for adequate monthly cash flow. Having enough cash flow will help you avoid ministry interruptions and delays in the coming years.</li>\n<li ><strong>What happens to the interest on my loan?</strong><br />\nSometimes banking institutions use their profits to help fund political or social agendas, which may or may not fit with your own or your church’s spiritual convictions. In this case, it’s wise to know your lender.</li>\n<li ><strong>Do you have loan payment amortizations that will fit with our future cash flow needs?</strong><br />\nAmortization is the term used to indicate the amount of the scheduled monthly loan payment. You will want the payment to be manageable for your church without hurting your cash flow. It may be difficult to expand your church’s outreach if you’re struggling to make the mortgage payment every month.</li>\n<li ><strong>Do you have long-term fixed rate loan terms that will protect our church for the future?</strong><br />\nPerhaps even more important to understand is the loan term. This is the amount of time by which you must pay off your loan. Ask if the lender offers permanent financing for churches. In commercial lending, it's common to find loans that are purportedly fixed and permanent. This can be misleading. Many institutions assign their fixed rates to a very short loan term. This means that although your rate will not go up, you'll only have a few years to pay off the entire loan. A true permanent loan is a more stable arrangement with less financial risk to the church. This type of financing stands in stark contrast to short-term balloon notes—often misinterpreted as fixed-rate loans. Although these balloon notes may carry attractive interest rates, they come with a major downside: You must pay off the entire remaining loan amount in one lump sum (called a balloon payment) at the end of the loan term, which is usually only five years. If you can't pay off the loan, you will have to refinance, with all its associated costs and credit re-approval, just to borrow the same money again. It's a financially risky option for most churches and generally takes more time to pay off the loan in the long run.</li>\n<li ><strong>How do you calculate your debt service coverage ratio when qualifying our church for a loan?<br />\n</strong>To decide whether or not you qualify for a loan, banks and credit unions generally evaluate your financial situation using the same ratios they use for businesses. In some cases, an institution could end up providing an inflated picture of your church’s available income—leading you to borrow more than you can comfortably afford. Additionally, certain aspects of a church’s finances, such as staff salaries, are left out of the equation altogether. Understanding how the institution decides how much money you qualify for will help you better understand your <strong>true borrowing capacity</strong>—the amount you can afford to pay back without cutting ministry and staff.</li>\n<li ><strong>How long does the loan process take and do I need to adjust my project timeline to fit?<br />\n</strong>It’s exciting to make plans for the future, and congregations love to see quick progress. Realize the actual time frame from applying to closing on a loan may be longer than expected. You may not be able to start building as quickly as you may have expected.</li>\n<li ><strong>To what extent can you offer flexibility in the event we experience unanticipated difficulty making payments?<br />\n</strong>This question must be brought up carefully, as you do not want to give a lender the impression that you are a financial risk to them. However, you need to understand their policies regarding late or missed payments and how willing they may be to work with your church if needed. This is another area where it becomes important to know your lender. An institution with which you have a strong relationship is more likely to extend flexibility or be willing to reach a new agreement during times of need. It could mean the difference between sinking and surviving.</li>\n<li ><strong>What guarantee can you provide that our loan will be renewed after the fixed term period or balloon term?<br />\n</strong>If you can’t pay off the loan by the end of the term, you’ll have to refinance, paying all costs and fees again, as well as receiving a new interest rate based on the current market. A loan officer may tell you there will be no problem with renewing your loan when the term expires, but unless it is in writing, it isn’t a guarantee. If you know your church will need more than just a few years to pay off the full amount, it’s better to opt for a longer loan term, even if it means an adjustable rate. A rate cap will ensure the rate stays manageable while you take the necessary time to pay off the loan.</li>\n<li ><strong>Do you offer rate caps</strong>?<br />\nA rate cap is a ceiling for an adjustable interest rate. Rate caps are in a church’s best interest. If a loan has a variable interest rate feature, it is important to protect the church from large increases in the interest rate. Although many variable interest rate loans offer attractive rates, beware of the impact to a church’s cash flow when the payment changes. A rate cap for both the adjustment period and a maximum for the life of the loan is important.</li>\n<li ><strong>Are there prepayment penalties or termination fees</strong>?<br />\nOften low interest rates come with conditions. Look closely at the fine print to see if one of those conditions is a penalty for paying off your loan sooner than anticipated. Lending institutions enforce these penalties to ensure they receive a certain amount of money from the borrower. Sometimes the penalties can be disguised as interest rate termination fees or other third-party fees if the loan is pre-paid prior to the end of the loan term.</li>\n<li ><strong>What additional services do you offer?<br />\n</strong>The answer to this question will help you distinguish between the many lending institutions available to you. Look for services that go beyond the funding of your project. Can they refer you to qualified building firms and architects? Do they offer help to manage the disbursement of funds? Do they provide consultation for planning, design, or construction? Can they provide consultation on a stewardship initiative to help raise funds internally?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>While there are many questions you could ask potential lenders, these 12 will help you evaluate how different institutions compare within the unique world of church lending. As you shop for your next loan, make sure your questions serve to protect and build your ministry.</p>\n<p>To explore church financing options, call 888.599.6015 to speak to one of our loan consultants.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Recent stock market growth has led to significant appreciation of stocks, creating a prime gifting opportunity. However, not all giving methods offer the same impact. You might consider simply selling your appreciated stocks and sending a cash gift to your chosen ministry, but the taxes you may pay could make this a less-than-optimal method. There is a better approach.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Instead of selling and simply writing a check to your chosen ministry, consider gifting the appreciated stocks themselves. By doing so, you may be able to increase income, avoid upfront capital gains, and potentially create a charitable deduction, all of which can increase your giving impact.</p>\n<p><strong>3 Tools Perfect for Appreciated Stocks</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Donor Advised Fund</strong><br />\nA Donor Advised Fund (<span>DAF</span>) is a flexible giving tool that allows you to continue to control the amount and timing of your gifts to ministry—while realizing tax benefits now. Under this agreement, charitable contributions may be made in your name and you can make ongoing recommendations as to how funds will be distributed to ministry. A gift to a <span>DAF</span> can provide you with a charitable income tax deduction and help you potentially avoid capital gains taxes on appreciated assets such as stocks.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Gift Annuity</strong><br />\nFor individuals over the age of 70, funding a Gift Annuity with stocks may provide a guaranteed income stream for you and your spouse for life. As the donor, payments and rates are calculated based on your life expectancy. It’s a great solution if you have appreciated stocks because it pays an attractive fixed payment guaranteed for life, as well as offering special tax benefits. Upon your death, ministry will be blessed with the remaining funds.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Charitable Remainder Trust</strong><br />\nEstablishing a Charitable Remainder Trust may provide lifetime income for you and your spouse and also potentially provide income to children or other third parties for up to 20 years. It’s an excellent alternative to an outright sale of appreciated stocks. The funding of the trust creates an immediate charitable tax deduction, and stocks sold may avoid imposition of upfront capital gains. Income is payable to named parties in either fixed or annually adjusted payments. Upon termination of the trust’s term, the remaining principle is transferred to a named charity or ministry of your choice.</p>\n<p>In today’s market, appreciated stocks can provide a beneficial alternative to giving cash to ministry. It’s an alternative that can maximize your giving impact for years to come.</p>\n<p>For more information about these planned giving tools, call 866.621.1787 to speak to one of our consultants.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>In the wake of new state laws and statutes allowing same-sex marriage, some pastors wonder if their refusal to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies puts them in a liable position. Add to that a refusal to hire employees based on sexual orientation, and some may feel like a large target has been painted on their church—making them vulnerable to a lawsuit. Not to worry. This article will help put those fears to rest.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>According to Dr. Richard Hammar, legal counsel for the Assemblies of God, no current state law or statute sanctioning same-sex marriage impinges on religious freedom. <strong>At the present time, a pastor has not been held liable for refusing to marry a same-sex couple or host their wedding at the church.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Here’s how the states currently stand:</strong></p>\n<p>Twelve states and Washington D.C. have legally permitted same-sex marriage or soon will. These states are Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Four state supreme courts have found same-sex marriage to be constitutionally mandated under their state constitutions. These include California, Connecticut, Iowa, and Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the divide, six states have enacted legislation that defines marriage as between a man and woman (prohibiting same-sex marriage). Furthermore, in 30 states the voters have enacted state constitutional amendments defining marriage as a union between a man and woman, implicitly rejecting same-sex marriage.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Federal Defense of Marriage Act (1996) states that in terms of federal law, marriage is defined as a union between a man and a woman. Eight federal courts have ruled that this statute is unconstitutional. Five of those are currently being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. During this term, perhaps as soon as summer 2013, they should render a ruling on those five cases, as well as the legality of same-sex marriage in general.</p>\n<p>In California, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that Proposition 8, a public referendum rejecting the state's 2008 mandate of same-sex marriage, was unconstitutional. That case has been appealed to the Supreme Court and is expected to be resolved in the summer of 2013. The thing to note from the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeal ruling is that it was based on the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The U.S. Constitution trumps all state laws and all state constitutional provisions. This summer, the Supreme Court may simply rule that same-sex marriage is a state matter, not a federal one. However, if the Supreme Court agrees with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, saying that the federal constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws mandates that same-sex couples be given the same right to marry as heterosexual couples, all 30 state constitutional provisions, all six state statutes, will be rendered unconstitutional.</p>\n<p><strong>What would such a ruling mean for my church?</strong></p>\n<p>As it stands, the only state rulings mandating same-sex marriage each articulate that even though those courts recognize such marriage to be constitutionally mandated, it does not mean clergy are required to perform them or that churches are required to host them. No court has said to the contrary.</p>\n<p>Even if the Supreme Court rules in favor of same-sex marriage, it won’t mean clergy are going to be exposed to any liability, civil or criminal, for following their conscience and their religious beliefs. If the Supreme Court doesn’t duck the issue altogether, it will do what all the state courts have done without exception—give a broad expression to the religious freedom of both churches and clergy to marry or not marry based on their religious convictions.</p>\n<p><strong>Three conclusions: </strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li >No minister is required to perform a same-sex or any other marriage contrary to his or her religious beliefs. Anything you’ve heard to the contrary is false.</li>\n<li >No church is required to allow its facilities to be used for same-sex marriages in violation of its religious beliefs.</li>\n<li >You do not need to change your bylaws to prohibit same-sex marriage.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmgolEHis6I&amp;list=PLS35Et-nHKCyBb23R2pHbuDu-YmGETdQT&amp;index=1\">Watch the full Risk Mgmt LIVE episode on sexual orientation.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Employment discrimination based on sexual orientation</strong></p>\n<p>At this point, no federal law prohibits employment discrimination based on sexual orientation by private employers.</p>\n<p>Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers with 15 or more employees from discriminating on the base of race, color, national origin, gender, or religion. The word “gender” has never been interpreted to mean “sexual orientation.” Last year the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) did define it to mean sexual orientation, but only with respect to federal employees, not private employers.</p>\n<p>The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which has been submitted to most sessions of Congress for the past 20 years would ban discrimination by private employers based on sexual orientation or sexual identity. However, this law has never passed. In addition, it contains a very broad exemption, which says the act would not apply to any corporation, association, educational institution, or society that is exempt from the religious discrimination provisions of Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Bottom line: Even if ENDA is ever enacted, it won’t apply to church employers.</p>\n<p>Twenty-one states have enacted statutes prohibiting employment discrimination by private employers on the basis of sexual orientation. In addition to banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, many of these state laws also ban it in public accommodations and housing. Some laws ban gender identity discrimination. However, they all have broad religious exemptions.</p>\n<p><strong>The Ministerial Exception</strong></p>\n<p>The United States Supreme Court recognized the Ministerial Exception unanimously last year. It states that civil courts are barred by the First Amendment guarantee of religious freedom from intervening or interfering with employment disputes between clergy and churches, ministers and churches. For example, a minister could claim, “I wasn’t hired by this church because I’m gay” or “I was terminated because I revealed my sexual identity,” but no federal court will hear such a case because of the Ministerial Exception.</p>\n<p><strong>How can my church protect itself as an employer?</strong></p>\n<p>Employment practices are not covered under a standard liability policy. Many churches have found themselves in the middle of an employment dispute only to realize that their liability insurance does not cover employment. Even if you only have one or two employees, it is good at least to have minimal coverage and is very inexpensive. Two things are recommended:</p>\n<ol>\n<li >Purchase a Directors and Officers Liability policy.</li>\n<li >Add an endorsement for Employment Practices Liability to the policy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more information about church liability policies, call AGFinancial Insurance Solutions at 866.662.8210.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

The bad news is living longer costs more. But even if you’re retiring as soon as this next year, it’s not too late to prepare for these four longevity challenges:</p>\n<ol>\n<li ><strong>Inflation.</strong> With retirement lasting up to 30 years, it is not enough that retirement savings provide enough income to meet today’s needs. The income also needs to be able to rise as the years go by. With an inflation rate of 3%, your cost of living may double in roughly 24 years. One way to prepare is to continue contributing as much as possible to your retirement accounts during retirement.</li>\n<li ><strong>Asset Management.</strong> Traditionally, one of the main concerns of retirees was market risk, or losing value due to market volatility. With the rise of longevity and inflation, retirees now face the balancing act of hedging against market volatility and being too conservative. The best hedge against long-term inflation is to have some exposure in the equity market.</li>\n<li ><strong>Retirement Plan Withdrawal Rate.</strong> Another key to controlling longevity and inflation risk is to have an appropriate withdrawal rate from retirement accounts. If the withdrawal rate is too high, it will hinder the growth of the principal and thus limit your ability to grow your income. As a general rule of thumb, the optimal withdrawal/distribution rate is 4% increased each year for inflation.</li>\n<li ><strong>Health Care.</strong> Ironically, the same health care advances that drive longevity can also translate into additional cost to you. Current estimates suggest a couple retiring will have close to $220,000 in out-of-pocket health care cost over time. <sup>2 </sup></li>\n</ol>\n<p>No matter your age, in setting aside funds for your future, it’s best to assume you may live a long time on that income and save accordingly. If you’re a little overwhelmed by these challenges—don’t worry. Smart planning can keep you on the path toward a long and enjoyable retirement.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>In light of the two recent Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage, questions have arisen as to the impact for churches and pastors. For instance, some are wondering if they will be exposed to liability for refusing to marry a same-sex couple if their church happens to be located in one of the 13 states currently allowing such marriages. Those states include California, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Washington D.C. also permits same-sex marriage. While the short answer to the liability question is no, let’s take a closer look at each ruling to understand why.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>Ruling #1: DOMA</strong></p>\n<p>The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was enacted by Congress in 1996. Section three of this statute defined marriage as a union between a man and woman for federal purposes. The Supreme Court ruled that this provision is unconstitutional for two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It invaded the province of state and local government to make regulations about marriage.</li>\n<li>It violated article five of the Constitution, which incorporates the concept of equal protection of the laws.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It’s important to point out that the Court did not issue a sweeping endorsement of same-sex marriage in all 50 states. Rather, in the 13 states where same-sex marriage is legal, DOMA is now declared unconstitutional and marriage is defined to include both opposite-sex and same-sex couples. This ruling affects 1,136 federal provisions, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>403(b) beneficiaries</li>\n<li>Social Security benefits for spouses</li>\n<li>Social Security survivors benefits for spouses</li>\n<li>Tax-free status of employer-provided health care for spouses and dependents</li>\n<li>Pre-tax SRA contributions to cafeteria plans for spouses</li>\n<li>Flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts for spouses’ expenses</li>\n<li>Sales of principle residences</li>\n<li>Joint tax returns</li>\n<li>Estate taxes—transfers at death are exempt from tax</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ruling will create a disparity in the way same-sex couples are treated depending on state law because in the 37 states where marriage is still defined as a union between a man and woman, DOMA still applies. Some legal analysts predict that this disparity in treatment will lead to legal challenges that ultimately result in another Supreme Court ruling addressing the question of whether same-sex marriage is a fundamental right protected under the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the potential impact on ministers and churches?</strong></p>\n<p>For many churches, the tax status of medical insurance paid by the employer may be one of the biggest impacts of this ruling in the 13 states. For churches located in one of the 37 states which doesn’t recognize same-sex marriage, the new federal benefits will not be available to same-sex couples. This is where the disparity created by this ruling comes into play. If a church is opposed to same-sex marriage and is located in one of these 13 states, the church will not be exposed to liability for refusing to hire based on sexual orientation, due to the broad religious exemptions in all state laws regarding employment discrimination. </p>\n<p>No matter where they’re located, ministers will not be exposed to legal liability for refusing to marry a same-sex couple.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruling #2: Proposition 8</strong></p>\n<p>Proposition 8 in the state of California was started in 2008 as a voter initiative to decide that marriage should be defined as between a man and woman. It was deemed to be unconstitutional and invalid by a district court at the state level. The proponents continued to appeal the ruling all the way to the Supreme Court. At that point, the Court could have made a sweeping ruling permitting all same-sex couples to marry, which would have essentially swept away the laws and constitutional provision surrounding same-sex marriage in 37 states. Instead, they dismissed the appeal on a technicality, saying the proponents did not have standing to make the appeal. This decision had the effect of reinstating the original district court ruling that Proposition 8 is indeed unconstitutional—same-sex marriage remains legal in California.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the potential impact on ministers and churches?</strong></p>\n<p>This ruling has nothing to do with religious freedom for ministers and churches in deciding whom they will marry or not marry. In fact, the language of the district court ruling includes the following religious exemption: “Affording same-sex couples the opportunity to obtain the designation of marriage will not impinge upon the religious freedom of any religious organization, official, or any other person; no religion will be required to change its religious policies or practices with regard to same-sex couples, and no religious officiate will be required to solemnize a marriage in contravention of his or her religious beliefs.”</p>\n<p>If you happen to be located in California or one of the other 12 states, which allow same-sex marriage, keep these points in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are previous Supreme Court rulings in different cases, which imply the protection of ministers. This suggests a strong probability that the courts will recognize the authority of the First Amendment, which protects religious freedom.</li>\n<li>No court in the 237-year history of our country has ever found a minister liable for refusing to marry anyone, for any reason based on his or her religious or doctrinal views.</li>\n<li>The laws of each of the 13 states where same-sex marriage is legal recognize the right of clergy to marry or not marry based on their religious views.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>From both rulings, we can draw four reassuring conclusions:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>No minister is required to perform a same-sex (or any other) marriage contrary to his or her religious beliefs.</li>\n<li>No church is required to allow its facilities to be used for same-sex marriages in violation of its religious beliefs.</li>\n<li>No church bylaw amendments are necessary at this time.</li>\n<li>Marriage for purposes of federal law includes same-sex couples in the 13 states that recognize same-sex marriage. The other 37 states, which don’t recognize same-sex marriage, remain unaffected.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more information about managing church risk and reducing liability, call AGFinancial Insurance Solutions at 866.662.8210.</p></p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Whether you’re a first-time borrower or are already familiar with commercial lending, this list of pitfalls will help you spot potential dangers when looking for the right church loan. With an understanding of these risk areas, you will be better prepared to enjoy smart financing for your growing church.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>1. Borrowing too much</strong></p>\n<p>A common pitfall churches face when borrowing money is not knowing how much they should borrow. This can place a church at risk of being allowed by a bank to borrow too much, to the detriment of ministry. The reason for this is that most banks lend primarily to businesses rather than churches. The ratios used to assess businesses often don’t apply to churches because they are structured differently. Using wrong evaluation methods can skew the picture of a church’s available income. To avoid this, a church first needs to understand the financial scope of its project(s) and true borrowing capacity based on ratios that suit churches. This is one important reason your lender needs to be able to see your church through the lens of ministry to fully understand what a financially healthy church looks like and assess accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Hidden costs of short-term financing</strong></p>\n<p>Just as in residential lending, the shorter the loan is, the lower the interest rate will be. However, chasing the shortest term with the lowest rate is not always in the best interest of a church in the long run. Although short-term mortgage products—typically considered 5 years or less—can have enticing introductory rates, there are many hidden costs to consider. If the loan is not paid off by the end of the term, it will have to be refinanced. Of course, there are closing costs to consider, but refinancing a short-term loan also <em>increases</em> the time that it takes to pay it off. In addition, each time a loan is refinanced, the payment schedule starts over from the beginning, with more interest and less principal in each payment.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Hidden risks of short-term financing</strong></p>\n<p>Along with hidden costs, other risks also come into play with short-term loans. For example, each time the loan needs to be refinanced, the church will have to re-qualify for the loan again. If there are changes in property value, revenue, personnel costs, etc. a church could find itself facing foreclosure if it can’t find a lender who will refinance the loan – even if the church is able to make the payments.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Interest rate risk</strong></p>\n<p>After the residential mortgage crisis of 2007, people became overly cautious toward adjustable rate mortgages. However, in commercial lending an adjustable rate mortgage is standard. Although some short-term loans have fixed rates, a church will almost certainly need to refinance at the end of the term. It will then be subject to whatever the market interest rates are at that time. A more stable option for churches would be a longer term, adjustable rate loan with rate caps in place both for the adjustment period and a maximum for the life of the loan. This guarantees stability with the loan, regardless of index rate changes.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Prepayment penalties</strong></p>\n<p>These are also called “interest rate termination fees” or “other third-party fees.” A prepayment penalty charges a fee to make extra principal payments, whether a little at a time with each payment or all at once with a refinance. For example, when index rates drop and a church wants to refinance to take advantage of the lower rates, they may find themselves locked into their current loan because of prepayment penalties, which can be costly. Being unable to refinance without incurring such a fee could negatively impact the church’s financial capability for ministry growth.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Restrictive covenants</strong></p>\n<p>Numerous issues are often found in the fine print of a loan, the affects of which churches may not understand until it is too late. Before signing, be sure to study all the details of a loan agreement and the ramifications they could have on ministry.</p>\n<p>Now that you better understand these six areas of risk in commercial lending, you’ll be equipped to make a more informed financing decision that’s in the best interest of your ministry.</p>\n<p><em>Overwhelmed?

Laddering allows you to receive the benefit of earning the higher-interest rates of longer term investments while still enjoying some liquidity.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example of how laddering can work: Rather than investing $60,000 for a one-year period and renewing each year at the often lower one-year rate, you could create a three-year ladder and put $20,000 in a one-year investment, $20,000 in a two-year investment, and $20,000 in a three-year maturity at probable higher interest rates. After the first year, you would take the maturing one-year investment and purchase a new three-year investment. After the second year, the initial two-year investment matures and you would purchase a new three-year investment. Do the same with the initial three-year investment. Starting in year four, all of your investments will be earning the higher three-year rate. Additionally, you would have access to a third of your principal as it matures each year.</p>\n<p>Using this laddered approach, you may achieve more consistent returns over the long term, even if interest rates fluctuate.</p>\n<p>To learn more about laddering and how it can work for you, call toll-free at 866.621.1787 to speak to an AGFinancial investment consultant.

As a follow-up to our post <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid9896312-questions-to-ask-when-shopping-for-a-church-loan/\">12 Questions to Ask When Shopping for a Church Loan</a>, below is a list of common questions lenders ask borrowers.</p>\n<ol>\n<li ><strong>What is your project timeline? </strong>The amount of time it takes from applying for a loan to actually receiving funds may be longer than you expect. Having a good idea of the steps involved to complete your project will prepare you to answer this question and more easily adjust your timeline to fit the loan application process, if needed.</li>\n<li ><strong>Can you provide the church’s financial statements?</strong><br />\nLending institutions ask to see a church’s financial statements because they are an accurate reflection of the financial health of the church (i.e. the church’s ability to repay a loan). Some institutions are more thorough than others in their assessment of church financials. Churches should be prepared to provide at least three years of income/expense statements and balance sheets. In general, the lender will look at the statements for evidence of stability and borrowing capacity.</li>\n<li ><strong>What is your plan for paying off the debt?</strong><br />\nAnother way this question may be asked is “what is your plan for growth?” Being able to clearly outline your goals for ministry growth over the next few years helps build your credibility as a borrower. Furthermore, having a defined plan for repayment allows for realistic budget planning and reduces risk of default.</li>\n<li ><strong>How much cash are you investing into the project?</strong><br />\nThis question allows a lender to see how much you need to borrow as compared to the total cost of the project and helps them calculate certain ratios and risk level. It also provides tangible evidence of the church’s level of commitment to the project.</li>\n<li ><strong>Has your project been approved by church leadership?</strong><br />\nWhile not every lender will ask this, it’s an important question. Some church bylaws require approval of the board or even the church membership before acquiring new debt, while for others the pastor makes the final decision. Before you apply for a loan, be sure all essential stakeholders are informed and supportive.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As you think through your financing needs and engage lending institutions, keep these questions in mind for a more effective discussion that moves your church forward.</p>\n<p>To explore church financing options, call 866.621.1787 to speak to one of our loan consultants.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <h3 ><strong>IRAs not only help you save for retirement, they may provide a savings at tax time.</strong></h3>\n<p>Contributions to an individual retirement account, Traditional or Roth, are one of the easiest ways for a qualified individual to invest in a tax-favored manner. And contributions to a Traditional IRA may be made up until April 15, 2013, or your filing date, not including extensions, and still potentially provide favorable tax benefits for your 2012 taxable income.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>The beginning of the year is an opportune time to consider the many options and strategies offered by IRAs.</p>\n<h3>Types of IRAs</h3>\n<p><strong>Traditional IRA</strong>. This IRA is a tax-advantaged account that allows earnings and deductible contributions to grow tax-deferred. This means you don’t pay income taxes on the earnings and deductible contributions until you begin taking distributions—usually after you retire and when your tax bracket is probably lower.</p>\n<p><strong>Roth IRA.</strong> With a Roth IRA, you can accumulate earnings on a tax-deferred basis and withdraw earnings tax-free for qualified distributions. Unlike a Traditional IRA, Roth contributions are not deductible on your federal tax return.</p>\n<h3>Contribution Limits</h3>\n<p>The 2012 contribution limit to an IRA is $5,000, or $6,000 if you’re age 50 or older. Contribution limits have increased for 2013. You may now contribute up to $5,500 ($6,500 for age 50+) for both you and your spouse as long as you meet the income requirements for funding an IRA. Contributions may be made to your IRA at any time during the year or by the filing due date of your tax return for that year, not including extensions. For most people, this means that contributions for 2012 must be made by April 15, 2013.</p>\n<h3>IRA Charitable Distributions (QCD)</h3>\n<p>For those IRA owners aged 70½, all or a portion of your required minimum distribution (RMD) can be used to make charitable distributions of up to $100,000 to qualified 501(c)(3) charities, bypassing the taxation of the distribution. An <a href=\"/blog/bid107913planned-giving-101-donor-advised-funds/\">endowment</a> would also qualify to receive a charitable IRA distribution for perpetual giving to a ministry or cause of your choice.</p>\n<h3>Rollovers</h3>\n<p>Simplify your retirement savings. The hassle of tracking multiple 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and other IRAs can be time-consuming and costly—especially if you’re not paying attention to the fees the financial company may be charging. A great way to overcome the stress of multiple retirement accounts is to roll your funds into a single retirement account.</p>\n<p>If you do not currently have an IRA, you still have time to open one before the end of the tax filing season to receive tax benefits. Contact an investment representative at <strong>866.621.1783</strong> to learn more.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>In an effort to save on taxes during retirement, more people are choosing Roth IRAs for their unique tax benefits. Let's look at six reasons you might consider adding a Roth IRA to your current portfolio.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>1. Grow and Withdraw Money Tax-free</strong></p>\n<p>Because contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax money, there is no tax deduction for contributions. However, interest earned on the money may be withdrawn tax-free, if conditions are met.<br />\nAt any time and for any reason, you may withdraw up to 100% of your contributions without taxes or penalties. Earnings distributed are tax-free after the completion of a 5-year aging period on the account, starting with the first taxable year after you begin contributions and one of the following conditions are met:<br />\n• 59½ or older<br />\n• Disability or death<br />\n• Purchasing your first home (a $10,000 exception)</p>\n<p><strong>2. No Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike Traditional IRAs and generally 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and other employer-sponsored retirement plans, a Roth IRA does not require you to take a minimum distribution during your lifetime. This benefits you if distributions are not neccessary for living expenses. Since you are not required to take minimum distributions, your money may continue to accumulate, leading to the third reason you might consider a Roth IRA.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Protect Beneficiaries from Taxes</strong></p>\n<p>Having no required minimum distributions means you may be able to leave more to your heirs. Upon your death, RMDs are required for inherited Roth IRAs; however, those distributions generally may still be taken tax-free. Conversely, income inherited from a Traditional IRA is taxable. Those taxes may be significant if the inherited amount pushes your heirs into a higher tax bracket.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Increase Tax Flexibility in Retirement</strong></p>\n<p>Adding a Roth IRA to your retirement portfolio may offer a way to decrease tax liability. This is accomplished by using distributions from both a Traditional IRA and Roth IRA. For example, if you want to stay within a certain tax bracket, you can withdraw money from a Traditional IRA up to the tax bracket’s ceiling and then use Roth IRA withdrawals for any needs above that ceiling.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Reduce or Avoid the Medicare Surtax</strong></p>\n<p>The Medicare surtax is calculated according to your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). Qualified Roth IRA withdrawals don’t count toward MAGI, whereas RMDs from a Traditional IRA do. RMDs may increase your vulnerability to the surtax depending upon your income in retirement.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Contribute as Long as You Have Earned Income</strong></p>\n<p>With a Traditional IRA, you are not allowed to contribute past age 70½, even if you have earned income. A Roth IRA, on the other hand, allows you to contribute as long as you have earned income, no matter your age. This helps maximize earnings during your lifetime.</p>\n<p><strong>2013 Annual Contribution Limits*:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>• Under age 50 — $5,500</strong><br />\n<strong>• Age 50 or older — $6,500</strong></p>\n<p>*Income limitations may apply. Contact your tax advisor.</p>\n<p>With so many good reasons to consider a Roth IRA, contact us today to see if adding one to your retirement portfolio would be beneficial to you.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>On November 4, 2011, the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed criminal charges against <strong>Jerry Sandusky</strong> that included multiple counts of child molestation. Several of the offenses occurred between 1998 and 2002, during which time Sandusky was the Defensive Coordinator for the Penn State University football team with unrestricted access to the University’s football facilities. On June 22, 2012, a jury found Sandusky guilty of 45 counts of the criminal charges against him.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>In the days and weeks surrounding the announcement of the charges, the University’s Board of Trustees struggled to decide how to respond to the scandal. On November 11, 2011, the Trustees appointed a <strong>Special Investigations Task Force</strong> under the direction of Special Investigative Counsel and former FBI director Louis Freeh to perform an independent, full and complete investigation. The Special Investigative Counsel was asked to provide recommendations regarding University governance, oversight, and administrative policies and procedures that will better enable the University to prevent and more effectively respond to incidents of sexual abuse of minors in the future.</p>\n<p>The Task Force issued its final report in July of 2012. The report contained <strong>120 recommendations</strong> to assist University administrators, faculty, staff and the Board, in improving how they govern and provide protection for children in University facilities and programs. The Task Force, which included former federal prosecutors and FBI agents, represents the most competent and professional body ever assembled to formulate <strong>risk management strategies</strong> to reduce the risk of child molestation in child-serving charities. Attorneys representing victims of child molestation will almost certainly cite the findings of the Task Force as they attempt to demonstrate negligence on the part of churches, schools, and other youth-serving charities for not implementing or updating procedures to adequately protect minors. For this reason, it is important for church leaders to be familiar with the Task Force's recommendations, and to use them in implementing, or revising, appropriate procedures and safeguards. The recommendations with <strong>special relevance to churches</strong> will be the focus of a live video stream on <strong>Tuesday, August 28</strong>.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p><strong>Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it? </strong><em>Luke 14:28<br />\n</em></p>\n<p>Have you put much thought into your retirement strategy? Unfortunately, too many people don’t give this area of stewardship the attention it deserves. In Luke 14:28 we read a parable of simple planning habits that go a long way. There’s no question that we should approach our retirement planning with the same care. Planning for retirement doesn’t have to feel overwhelming. Just make sure you’re aware of what you should and shouldn’t do when defining your retirement strategy.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>WORST STRATEGIES</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Cashing Out Between Jobs</em></strong><em><br />\n</em>If you’ve ever changed jobs, you know about the temptation to cash out your retirement plan. While it may not seem like much, taking just $1,000 as an early withdrawal can really hurt your retirement saving strategy. Not only does it reduce what you have set aside for your future, there are also financial penalties. If you’re under age 59½, you’ll have to pay a 10% penalty and the 401(k) company will generally withhold 20% for taxes. You’re much better off rolling the account over into an <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/investments/ira/\">IRA</a> or <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/403b/\">403(b)</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Chasing Returns</em></strong><em><br />\n</em>Retirement should be viewed as a marathon, not a sprint. Adjusting your entire retirement strategy based on the latest investment craze or the lure of a ‘guaranteed’ annuity can do more harm than good. In this case, the old saying, <em>“if it’s too good to be true, it probably is,” </em>couldn’t be more applicable. Before making a decision based on the idea of a higher return, first seek advice to make sure you’ve looked into all the fine print. Remember, higher returns are accompanied by <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/biggest-mistakes-investors-make-part-3/\">higher risk</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Depending on a Spouse’s Retirement Plan</em></strong><em><br />\n</em>One of the most common misconceptions about saving for retirement is that only one spouse needs to have an account. While this might have worked for some people in the past, it’s not necessarily the best strategy for couples today. This is especially true if both spouses have an employer-sponsored retirement plan available through their work. Make sure you take advantage of any retirement match you can get through your employer-sponsored retirement plan.</p>\n<p><strong>BEST STRATEGIES</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Consolidate Old Retirement Accounts</em></strong><em><br />\n</em>Becoming financially organized is key to formulating a good retirement strategy. Part of that organization should include rolling over old 401(k) accounts from previous employers. Doing so could give you a better idea of where you stand when it comes to saving for retirement. Even more, you’ll likely eliminate some of the maintenance fees that you’re paying by keeping old accounts open.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Start Early. Start Now.</em></strong><em><br />\n</em><a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid107731compound-interest-put-your-money-to-work/\">Compound interest</a> is simple: the more time you have the greater your account will grow. A 25-year-old who starts to save now will need to put a much smaller amount into their account when compared to someone who is just starting at age 45. No, it’s not an exciting revelation. But it’s true. The earlier you start saving, the better off you’ll be in retirement. Regardless of your age, <strong>the right time to start is now</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Utilize Housing Allowance – MINISTERS ONLY</em></strong><em><br />\n</em>Ministers enjoy a special benefit that’s available through the 403(b) plan within their denominational retirement account. That benefit is called the Retired Ministers Housing Allowance. This allows ministers to receive tax-free withdrawals from their retirement account to cover <a href=\"http://files.agfinancial.org/retirement/Housing-Allowance-Worksheet.pdf\">housing expenses</a> during their retirement years. Understanding this benefit could save you thousands of dollars in retirement and should be a strategy every minister should consider as they create their retirement plan.</p>\n<p>For more information on retirement strategies, contact us at <a href=\"mailto:retirement@agfinancial.org\">retirement@agfinancial.org</a> or by calling 866.621.1787.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Church leaders are faced with the grave responsibility of <strong>protecting the members of their congregation</strong>. While children are often the primary concern, it is also important to protect the volunteers that serve your ministry. </p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>One of the most devastating liabilities for a ministry to encounter is <strong>sexual misconduct</strong>. Few things can tear a church apart more than an allegation or confirmed incident of this nature. That is why it is important to implement safeguards to help protect both the children in your ministry and those who volunteer their time. Setting up controls to prevent incidents of sexual misconduct will give your organization the best chance of avoiding a sexual misconduct issue. If an incident occurs, the safeguards you have implemented will help provide the necessary defense. As a best practice, all volunteers should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a written application</li>\n<li>Be interviewed</li>\n<li>Go through a background check</li>\n<li>Have their references checked and documented</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Extend safeguards beyond the initial screening process. Create a standing policy that no child is left alone with an adult. It is also recommended that a volunteer be in good standing at the church for a minimum of six months before they are permitted to work with children. Help protect the members for your congregation by having a <strong>solid plan in place</strong>.</p>\n<p>Recently, I was able to see first-hand how much of an impact a plan can have on a church. In accordance with our church policy, I was interviewing a prospective volunteer for my Sunday school class. During the interview it came to my attention that he was a sexual predator. When I asked him about it, he told me that he had filled out background information before and nobody had ever addressed it with him. I explained to him that, according to our policy, he would need to be escorted to attend the church and we could not let him work with any children. He simply replied, “I will go to another church that needs me”. This could be a frightening situation for churches that don’t have procedures in place. </p>\n<p>Sexual misconduct is <strong>just one possible volunteer-related risk</strong> your organization could encounter. Have you considered what your church will do if a volunteer is hurt while helping? Will your church insurance coverage apply? Do you know how your insurance company will handle a liability issue? </p>\n<p>Learn more about <strong>best practices for volunteers</strong> including the selection process, discrimination laws, supervision, and limited immunity in our next Risk Management LIVE session on <strong>Wednesday, September 26</strong>.</p>\n<p>Jerry Sparks, President<br />AGFinancial Insurance Solutions<br /><a href=\"mailto:jsparks@agfinancialinsurance.org\">jsparks@agfinancialinsurance.org</a></p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

Through a unique marriage of stewardship and financial planning, it allows you to <strong>reach your goals for yourself, family, and ministry</strong>. There are several planned giving options available. This article will focus on Charitable Remainder Trusts.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>A <strong>Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT)</strong> is an extremely popular option that allows you to <strong>receive income payments</strong> for you and/or your family—and enjoy immediate <strong>tax benefits</strong>. In addition, you’ll have the benefit of giving to the ministry of your choice at the completion of your trust.</p>\n<p>To establish the trust, assets are transferred into the CRT, which then pays you income according to the terms of the trust. You can receive <strong>lifetime income payments</strong> for yourself and a spouse, and possibly up to 20 years to third parties. Upon completion of the trust’s term, the remainder of the trust’s principal is transferred to the ministry of your choice.</p>\n<p>A Charitable Remainder Trust is an <strong>irrevocable trust</strong>, which may offer immediate tax benefits and assures your wishes will be carried out. Income paid out by the trust is taxable to the income beneficiary.</p>\n<p>One of the most appealing benefits of the Charitable Remainder Trust is your ability to create a <strong>personalized plan</strong> according to your needs. Income payments can be fixed or in annually adjusted amounts. These payments can fluctuate and grow based on terms and investments. And you can choose the ministry or ministries, as well as levels of giving each receives.</p>\n<p>A Charitable Remainder Trust is ideal if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Want a customized income plan for yourself, your spouse, and/or your children</li>\n<li>Desire potential capital gains tax savings</li>\n<li>Want an immediate income tax deduction</li>\n<li>Have appreciated stock, real estate, or business interests</li>\n<li>Are preparing for a life or financial transition</li>\n<li>Have a moderate to large taxable estate</li>\n<li>Wish to give to ministry</li>\n<li>Plan to sell appreciated assets (business, real estate, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Charitable Remainder Trusts can be funded with <strong>cash, real estate, business interests, antiques, art, and other assets</strong>. Minimum required funding is $50,000 for cash or securities, or $100,000 for real estate. There are two options available for CRTs: Charitable Remainder Unitrust (CRUT) and Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust (CRAT). Speak with a planned giving consultant to determine which option is best for you and your needs.</p>\n<p>Planned giving provides unique benefits to the donor. The different options available allow you to create a <strong>custom financial plan</strong> that will fit your unique needs and circumstances while providing for your family and blessing others.</p>\n<p><strong>Has planned giving impacted you personally?</strong> Share your story below.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>How do you assemble a building team? Your church is a unique blend of people with its own leadership culture and decision-making process. Some churches prefer the diversity of opinion that a committee offers, while others find it easier to limit input to a select group of advisors.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>As you work on defining the leadership structure for your building program, consider how this project may differ from other church business. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investment.</strong> It’s typically the biggest investment of finances, time, and energy that your church will ever make.</li>\n<li><strong>Commitment.</strong> Those involved in the project can’t just make a motion, vote, and walk away. Instead, church building projects are an ongoing (and demanding) process.</li>\n<li><strong>Finality.</strong> Changing decisions throughout the building process can greatly increase your costs. The more decisions you keep throughout the process the smoother your project will go.</li>\n<li><strong>Expertise.</strong> A building project is more than just carpet and paint color. It is a specialized and complex process that includes dealing with contractors and other experts in the field.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A traditional building committee involves a cross-section of the congregation in an effort to receive input that represents the entire church body. While this approach brings many ideas and opinions to the table, it can also <strong>muddle the process</strong>. A large group can also create logistical issues when it comes to gathering together to make frequent or timely decisions.</p>\n<p>When it comes to putting a building committee in place, consider the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Small and Specialized.</strong> I recently met with a multi-site church of several thousand who had a building committee of one person. This may be extreme, but the idea with this approach is that less is more.</li>\n<li><strong>Design/Build Team.</strong> If you know who your architect and/or contractor will be, consider making them part of the team. Personally, I sit on more than one building committee as the lender’s representative and provide input to the process from that perspective.</li>\n<li><strong>Full Building Committee and Executive Committee.</strong> This is the closest to a traditional approach where there is a larger representation of the congregation that makes up the full committee. However, it also includes a small, specialized group to make the final decisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Evolutionary Approach.</strong>In this option, there is a different team for each stage of a project:\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Initial Project Conception.</em></strong> The pastor and/or board are the key members of this initial team, as they should be the first to know when it’s time to consider a project.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Feasibility.</em></strong> This small group may be comprised of mainly board and staff leadership. They will begin setting some parameters for the project. How much can we afford? What are our potential funding sources? What do we need to build? Do we need to step back and create a master plan or comprehensive long-term strategy for our facilities? This team will flush out priorities, needs, and available resources.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Financing.</em></strong> Some church cultures would dictate that the board maintains this role, while others appoint a committee that reports to the board. Either way, there will be plenty of details to consider regarding construction loans, temporary and permanent financing, capital campaigns, etc.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Master Planning.</em></strong> Master planning is the process of creating a comprehensive long-term strategy for your facilities. While this stage is not always part of the building process, it is often a necessity for more complex projects, new site construction, or projects that involve multiple buildings or phases. This team should involve outside consultants like a civil engineer, architect, builder, or design-build company.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Project Schematics and Design.</em></strong> This is the stage where a larger committee might be necessary in order to define the project, plan it, and work with the consultants. Make the designers and builders part of this team if possible. Collaboration among the professionals you are using for your project saves time and typically results in a building that meets the ministry need while staying within the budget parameters.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Final Design, Contract Negotiations and Construction. </em></strong>This is a stage where I would once again recommend a small, specialized “Executive Building Committee” made up of 3 or 4 people who can easily and quickly convene, make decisions, protect the pastor, and report back to the board. This team is appointed by the board and given certain boundaries within which to make decisions without slowing down the process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you build your team, I recommend <strong>appointing a single point person</strong> or “quarterback” to help lead the project. The point person will be part of the building team, but will be able to place the project as a higher priority than other team members. They will keep the project on track as they coordinate participants, maintain the schedule, facilitate communications, etc. Establishing a point person will also reduce some of the project responsibilities that often fall on the pastor. Some churches even hire someone to fill this role as an “owner’s representative”.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how you approach the leadership structure for planning and overseeing your church building program, <strong>do it intentionally, transparently, and boldly</strong>. Avoid making the mistake of bringing the masses to the decision when you should take the decision to the masses. Transparency and good communication can go a long way toward involving a congregation in a project without encumbering the process with too many people and opinions. The top reason people give to stewardship initiatives in building projects is because they trust their leadership. Take confidence in that trust and:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seek God</li>\n<li>Establish the Vision – what has He called you to do?</li>\n<li>Develop the Mission – how has He called you to do it?</li>\n<li>Execute – with boldness and as servant-leaders, be transparent in what you’re doing, why you’re doing it, and keep everyone informed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Have you gone through a church building project? How did you assemble <em>your</em> building team? </strong>We’d like to hear your story through the comment section below.</p>\n<p>Shawn M.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Your members, facilities, and the church’s assets are foundational pieces of your ministry. As a pastor, you need to make sure that they are adequately protected. Over the last two years there have been two presiding reasons why churches were brought to court: sexual incidents involving a minor and property disputes with the insurance carrier. Being brought into court in such a manner can be devastating to a ministry of any size. Fortunately, the risk of being involved in cases like these can be minimized through proper planning and implementing safeguards. </p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>Sexual Misconduct Cases</strong></p>\n<p>Below are some basic risk management tips to protect your church from being sued for having a sexual incident involving a child:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a written application for all employees and volunteers.</li>\n<li>Run a background check that includes a National Criminal Search and National Sex Offender Registry.</li>\n<li>Check two references on all workers with children. These references should have the ability to assess if the individual is suitable to work with minors.</li>\n<li>Have a policy that no adult or leader of any kind will be alone with a minor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Property Disputes</strong></p>\n<p>The best way to prevent an issue with your insurance carrier when an incident occurs is to have your property adequately insured. The amount of your coverage should be enough to replace the church and should be applicable to the types of loss your property may encounter.</p>\n<p>The basic risk management tips for preventing a property dispute are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have your insurance agent determine the replacement cost of your building, and then insure your property for the estimated replacement cost. </li>\n<li>Have special form coverage on your policy. Are you in a flood, earthquake or coastal area subject to hurricanes? Ask your agent about these coverages, exclusions, and deductibles.</li>\n<li>Ask your agent about Building Ordinance coverage and how this applies in your city. Some cities have ordinances that if a building is damaged more than 50%, it cannot be rebuilt. Or if you have 50% damage, you must bring your building up to the building codes of today. Understanding these codes is vital to having the right coverage for your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By following these basic risk management tips, you could greatly reduce the risk of your church being brought into court.

People want to feel safe when they come to church. It falls on the leadership to create an environment where safety is paramount. You may not be able to prevent a shooting from ever happening, but you can do a lot to increase overall security and be prepared to respond effectively to emergencies.\"</p>\n<p>A common security strategy churches employ is the use of concealed weapons. However, while this may help your congregation feel more secure, it could also have legal implications for your church. If you allow people to carry concealed weapons on your church property, it's important to keep some things in mind.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, churches that allow concealed weapons must <strong>create a policy</strong> to reflect that decision. The policy then needs to be clearly and regularly communicated to church attendees and consistently enforced. A church may decide not to allow concealed weapons on church premises; however, such a policy will likely exclude those whose job requires them to be armed at all times such as law enforcement officers, active military personnel, and other trained government officials.</p>\n<p>If a church decides to allow concealed weapons, several aspects need consideration:</p>\n<ol>\n<li >What are the proper licenses and permits required in your state?</li>\n<li >What training should be required?</li>\n<li >How will the church verify that individuals are properly licensed and trained?</li>\n<li >Will the church’s liability insurance cover any accidents that may occur involving a concealed weapon or will they deny the claim?</li>\n<li >How will the church’s liability insurance costs change as a result of the policy?</li>\n<li >What legal precedents have been established from recent cases involving concealed weapons laws?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are important questions to consider as you address the overall security plan for your church.</p>\n<p>For more information about the use of concealed weapons, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz7GLSLJEuU&amp;index=12&amp;list=PLS35Et-nHKCyBb23R2pHbuDu-YmGETdQT\">watch this Risk Mgmt LIVE recording</a> as Jerry Sparks and church law expert Richard Hammar discuss church shootings.</p>\n<p> This information is not legal or tax advice.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <h3 ><strong>“The wise man saves for the future but the foolish man spends whatever he gets.”<em>Proverbs 21:20</em></strong></h3>\n<p>This verse provides a stark contrast to the common phrase, <strong>“<em>the more you make, the more you spend.” </em></strong>With that mentality in mind, it shouldn’t be any surprise to us that the savings rate in America dropped from nearly double digits twenty-five years ago to negative one percent in 2006. As a nation, we spend more than we make. Poor consumption habits and inadequate savings have caused a lot of stress for families all across America. But cultural habits don’t have to be <strong>your</strong> habits.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>If there is one basic principle that we can take from Proverbs 21:20, it’s this: <strong>the key to financial success</strong> has little to do with how much you make, and everything to do with <strong>how you spend it</strong>. When we step back and look at our spending habits, we can make adjustments, learn to live on less, and increase our savings with much more success than we can by focusing all our efforts on trying to increasing our income.</p>\n<p>By learning how to save money in the small things, we can be more effective in saving for our long-term goals. The following list of <strong>10 practical money-saving tips</strong> can help you set aside some money each month so that you can focus on saving for your retirement and other long-term financial goals. Try implementing some of these and track how much your family is able to save over this next year.</p>\n<ol>\n<li ><strong>Combine your cable, Internet and telephone service</strong>. Companies now offer combined services that not only cost less, but also offer the convenience of a single bill. Called a Triple Play Package (Cable, Internet, and Phone), these combined service deals can save you a bundle.</li>\n<li ><strong>Get rid of Private Mortgage Insurance</strong>. If your down payment was less than 20%, you are probably paying PMI. Paying extra on your mortgage may help you to reach a loan-to-value ratio of 80% or less. Check with your lender and work with them to cancel PMI if you meet the requirements.</li>\n<li ><strong>Pay car insurance semi-annually or annually. </strong>Many insurance providers provide a discount for semi-annual or annual payments as opposed to monthly payments.</li>\n<li ><strong>Increase insurance deductibles.</strong> Increasing your deductible can lower your premiums, which allows you to save more each month. Just be sure you have cash available to cover the higher deductible.</li>\n<li ><strong>Take advantage of employer matches to your retirement account. </strong>The fastest return on your money is to take advantage of an employer match. You can’t afford not to save here!</li>\n<li ><strong>Automate savings. </strong>Many banks allow automatic monthly transfers from a checking account to a savings account. Direct a portion of your paycheck right into your savings account and make your savings automatic.</li>\n<li ><strong>Avoid extended warranties.</strong> The only time a warranty makes sense is when it will be devastating to your budget. Extended warranties for products like kitchen appliances, cameras or electronics are often money down the drain.</li>\n<li ><strong>Sign up for a flexible spending account. </strong>Your employer might offer a flexible spending account that allows you to set aside pretax dollars to pay for medical expenses. By using pretax dollars on these medical expenses, you’re essentially getting a discount equal to your tax bracket.</li>\n<li ><strong>Make an <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/investments/ira/\">IRA</a> contribution.</strong> Making pretax contributions to an IRA or 403(b) means that you pay less in taxes today. Your saved dollar goes a little further as it grows for your retirement.</li>\n<li ><strong>Use <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/retirement-planning/\">retirement</a> max provisions.</strong> For those savers over 50 in age, the IRS allows you to make a catch up contribution. This will boost your savings, may provide a tax break, and help you reach your retirement goals faster!</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

This will provide enough coverage to rebuild the facilities or replace business personal property with new property of the same kind that was lost.</li>\n<li><strong>Actual cash value (ACV).</strong> Churches might choose ACV if their facilities are in disrepair or the church would never rebuild that building type. Agents determine the value by taking the amount to replace the building or contents less the accumulated depreciation.</li>\n<li><strong>Coinsurance.</strong> This is the specific percentage of insurance to the value of the property insured. For instance, most companies require that a coinsurance rate of 80 or 90 percent of the property value be in place at the time of a loss. If the property was worth $100,000 and the coinsurance requirement is 80 percent, there would need to be at least $80,000 of coverage limits available to pay the claim without a penalty.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Determining Values</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Building coverage</strong> limits purchased by a church should be the cost to replace or rebuild the facilities with contract labor and new materials. It is the insured’s responsibility to make sure it has adequate limits to replace the building and its contents. When figuring the value of the building, include everything that is permanently attached. Pews, video projectors, sound systems, and appliances that are anchored to the building are factored into the building value. Chairs and portable equipment are business personal property or contents. Your agent can help you calculate the replacement cost.</p>\n<p><strong>Business personal property</strong> includes all items that are not part of the building. Because churches tend to add these items over time, they may not have adequate insurance coverage on these items. Consequently, coverage may not be adequate when a loss occurs, making it difficult or impossible to replace what the church owned. That is why having an updated inventory list with values for each property item is important. Storing a copy of your inventory list and supporting pictures or video off site will enable you to access the inventory in the event that a major incident destroys your church records.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong><em>Additional Property Coverage</em></strong><br />\nIt is important to note that standard property insurance does not always cover every aspect of your property and/or belongings. In the event that you need coverage outside of your standard plan, there are additional plans that cover these special circumstances. Make sure to check with your insurance carrier to determine what additional property coverage your ministry might need to consider.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Inland marine</strong><em> c</em>overs business personal property that may be taken off site or used at multiple locations.</li>\n<li><strong>Business income</strong> replaces lost or reduced income that the church suffers due to damage to the property by a covered event.</li>\n<li><strong>Electronic Data Processing (EDP) </strong>coverage provides insurance for computer hardware and software, phone systems, video systems, and other high-dollar hardware used in ministry.</li>\n<li><strong>Water damage</strong> covers floods and sewer backup.</li>\n<li><strong>Crime coverage<br />\n</strong><em>Money and securities coverage</em> will cover theft, disappearance or destruction of tithes and offerings.<br />\n<em>Employee dishonesty/fidelity bond coverage</em> protects the church if an employee steals from the church.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited law and ordinance enforcement </strong>extends coverage to three areas: the value of the undamaged portion of building that requires demolition, the expense attached to the demolition and removal of the undamaged portion, and the increased cost of construction that may arise from a more costly construction standard due to changes in laws and ordinances.</li>\n<li><strong>Pastor’s business or personal property </strong>covers the pastor’s personal property at the parsonage or rented dwelling.</li>\n<li><strong>Systems and equipment breakdown coverage </strong>extends coverage to include the explosion of a boiler or systems if they break down. Churches use this coverage to insure against breakdown replacement or repairs.</li>\n<li><strong>Builders risk/construction occupancy </strong>is a special policy that provides coverage for the new building and construction materials during construction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<div><span><strong>CHOOSING AN AGENCY</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n<p>It is important to place coverage with an insurance company that has a Best's Credit rating of A- or better. Also, place coverage with an agent that is knowledgeable about insuring churches. The General Council of the Assemblies of God has a customized insurance program for AG Churches. Church Mutual, an A+ rated company with over 100 years experience in insuring churches, underwrites this coverage.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, developing a good relationship with your agent is critical. Openly discussing your needs and current situation with your agent will enable you to better prepare for future scenarios. Keep in mind that your insurance agent is in the best position to clarify coverage, help you understand terminology, and keep your ministries protected. They are your best ally should the unthinkable happen.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your experience with insurance?</strong> Has an unexpected event either left you grateful you had insurance or wishing you did? <strong>Share your story</strong> in the comments below.</p>\n<p>Jerry Sparks, President<br />\nAGFinancial Insurance Solutions<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:jsparks@agfinancialinsurance.org\">jsparks@agfinancialinsurance.org</a></p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>In a recent incident, the individual members of a church board were personally sued for losses that occurred at their church. The lawsuit was a result of an incident that occurred at the church between a minor and an individual known to be a past sexual offender. Prior to this instance, the church did not have a policy concerning sexual offenders or predators, leaving the church and its board members unprotected.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Board members are a strong asset to your church as well as significant contributors. They volunteer time, offer guidance, and contribute talents that are invaluable. However, board decisions can potentially result in liability issues not only for the church, but for individual board members.</p>\n<p>Some states provide charitable immunity for volunteers. The purpose of this law is to encourage volunteers to serve by reducing their liability exposure while serving on the board of the charitable organization. Volunteers are usually defined as people providing services for a charitable organization (such as a church) who do not receive any compensation for their service(s) in excess of reimbursements for expenses that they incur. Members of a church board are included in this definition and, therefore, covered by the charitable immunity laws. Check your state laws to see if they provide charitable immunity and if your state’s definition of “volunteer” covers members of a church board.</p>\n<p>In most states, however, this immunity <em>does not</em> apply to any act or omission that is <em>intentional, willfully negligent, </em>or committed with <em>disregard </em>or<em> indifference</em> towards the safety of others.</p>\n<p>In the opening example, the church and each of it’s board members were individually named because the church did not have a policy concerning sexual offenders. The plaintiff alleged that the church board failed to provide and enforce a sexual offender policy after knowing a sexual offender attended the church and that constituted gross negligence since the omission was without regard for the safety of others.</p>\n<p>Members of a church board should use common sense. In addition, the church should provide its board members protection with a Directors, Officers, and Trustees (DOT) insurance policy. Surprisingly, this is not an automatic coverage in most insurance policies. Double-check your current policy to ensure that you have this coverage. In addition to paying for claims that arise out of the scope and operation of a church board, this insurance covers the cost of legal fees if and when a claim arises. Furthermore, remember that board members can be sued individually. It is imperative that your church has enough DOT insurance to protect the assets of ALL the members of your board.</p>\n<p>You need the talents of the best and brightest people on your board. Make sure you protect them by initiating proactive practices for all board proceedings and by providing them coverage with a proper Directors, Officers, and Trustees insurance policy.

Every year we see claims reported due to pipes freezing and bursting. These losses can be easily prevented with a few simple procedures.</p>\n<p><strong>Ensure outside walls are properly insulated.</strong> Without adequate insulation all other efforts will be a waste of time and money. Contact a local contractor to assess your needs and add insulation if necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Set your thermostat to keep the entire building warm.</strong> In one circumstance, a well-intending church member turned off the thermostat with the goal of saving money on utility bills. The result was frozen pipes that burst and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. If your facility has different heating zones, make sure that all of them are set to an appropriate temperature.</p>\n<p><strong>Leave faucets on exterior walls dripping during intense cold.</strong> If you plan to be away for several days—or if you think you might not be able to reach the building due to a storm—you might consider turning off the water entirely. Also, disconnect all hoses from exterior spigots. Leaving a hose connected to an exterior spigot is a common source of frozen and, subsequently, broken pipes.</p>\n<p><strong>Check your building frequently.</strong> In the example mentioned above, no one stopped by the church for two days while the broken pipe spewed water. If your staff doesn’t keep regular business hours, make it a point to stop by regularly and inspect the building. Check the thermostat to ensure it is heating all of the building properly. Quickly walk around the inside to look and listen for water leaks.</p>\n<p>AGFinancial Insurance Solutions specializes in protecting churches and ministries.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>On Sunday, May 22, 2011, a devastating EF5 tornado hit Joplin, Missouri. It ranks as one of the nation’s deadliest tornados, taking 159 lives and causing over $3 billion worth of damage. No one could have foreseen or truly prepared for such a tragedy. But it serves as a reminder for us to review and evaluate the plans we have for dealing with disaster.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Here are some considerations in evaluating your church’s disaster preparedness.</p>\n<p><strong>Replacement Cost Coverage.</strong><br />\nA disaster is not the time to find out if you have enough insurance coverage. One way to determine the proper amount is to ask your agent to run a Marshall-Swift appraisal to establish the replacement cost of your building. Many insurance policies require buildings be insured for 80% or 90% of replacement cost in order for the loss to be fully insured.(Replacement cost is not what the building may bring if it were to sell, or the market value.) There can be penalties for a partial loss, so you may only get a percentage of your total loss.</p>\n<p><strong>A Second Tragedy in Joplin.</strong><br />\nA distressing example is a church in Joplin that suffered a complete loss. The congregation had insured the building for the amount they believed it was worth, or $2,000,000. Unfortunately, the replacement cost of the building is $4,000,000, leaving this church and its members in a quandary of how to replace the building.</p>\n<p><strong>Inventory of Business Personal Property.</strong><br />\nIf your building is completely destroyed, will you have a record of the property inside? Use a video camera to document the business personal property (contents) in the church. Store the video file at a different location so a list can be made in case of a loss. Or keep a church inventory list (at a different location) including item description, date and place of purchase, and value or price paid. Remember, contents should also be insured for replacement cost.</p>\n<p><strong>Disaster Preparedness Plan.</strong><br />\nDoes your church have an emergency plan in the event a disaster strikes? Having a disaster plan in place so members and leaders know what to do in case of a fire, tornado, hurricane, flood, or earthquake is essential to any ministry.</p>\n<p><strong>Unheeded Warnings in Joplin.</strong><br />\nUnfortunately, the Joplin tornado hit on a Sunday afternoon while some churches were having services. One church did not heed any of the warnings and continued to have services, resulting in seven deaths. This lack of a reaction has placed the church a highly liable situation, due to the fact that the church did not take steps to protect the lives of its members.</p>\n<p>When disaster strikes, churches have a heart for helping those impacted. What if your church wants to send volunteers? In order to protect your ministry, the church should have an Activity Participation Agreement signed by each volunteer. Age limits on volunteers are also appropriate until the area is determined to be safe.</p>\n<p>Hopefully a disaster of this magnitude will never impact your area. Taking these steps will help ensure that if disaster does occur, you will be prepared and your church can continue its ministry.</p>\n<p>If you have questions on replacement costs, inventory checklists, disaster preparedness plans, or to obtaining an Activity Participation Agreement, contact AGFinancial Insurance Solutions at 866.662.8210 or visit <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/insurance\">agfinancial.org/insurance</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Prior to beginning the loan application process, it is important for pastors and church boards to understand the factors considered by lenders when evaluating a church loan. Although specific underwriting criteria vary, it is fair to say that most lenders evaluate church borrowers on three broad areas of performance. These are known as the three C’s of underwriting: character, cash flow, and collateral.<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Most lenders place considerable emphasis on assessing the overall character of the borrower. Specifically, will the church honor its commitment to repay the loan? In evaluating this measure, lenders look for a long history of operations, a good credit history, and strong, committed church leadership.</p>\n<p>The second focus is on cash flow. Lenders want to see a track record of positive income and attendance trends as well as a positive operating margin (revenues in excess of operating expenses). Flat or declining attendance or income can be a concern and operating losses mean that it may be difficult for the church to absorb a monthly mortgage payment within its budget.</p>\n<p>Finally, lenders need to know that the amount of collateral (real property such as land and buildings that will secure the loan) is sufficient to repay the loaned funds in the unlikely event of default.</p>\n<p>Churches interested in securing a loan with favorable rates and terms should be prepared to demonstrate strong performance in each of these three areas.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>What kind of inheritance should you leave your children?</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>As parents, our natural inclination is to take care of our children. We are concerned with being fair. But in reality, when it comes to leaving an inheritance, it can be challenging to balance fairness and stewardship.</p>\n<p>We are called to be prudent and thoughtful in our decisions to leave an inheritance for the next generation. Many expert sources conclude the average inheritance is spent in 14 to 18 months. This problem is addressed in Proverbs 20:21, “An inheritance gained hastily in the beginning will not be blessed in the end.”</p>\n<p>In anticipation of any future wealth transfer, the first step is to communicate with your spouse. It’s critical that you and your spouse answer some tough questions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do your children possess the same financial maturity? How do you decide between fiscal responsibility and fairness between beneficiaries?</li>\n<li>How will your children’s spouses react to an inheritance? What influence will the grandchildren have?</li>\n<li>If you have a blended family, what is your strategy?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The additional strategies below should be considered as you decide how you will leave your inheritance to your family and if you desire to leave more than money to your children.</p>\n<p><strong>Lump-sum inheritance versus ongoing income. </strong><br />Your children may each have a different skill set in dealing with finances. Good or bad, these habits are already established and evident. If a person is wise in handling finances, he or she will probably be wise in handling a lump sum. If not, receiving a lump sum would most likely multiply poor decisions. It may be more practical to consider an income stream that can be a source of retirement income for your children.</p>\n<p><strong>Continuing support of ministry. </strong><br />There are planned giving strategies available that can accomplish sustained giving for years to come. Both a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) and an Endowment allow you to provide future income for ministries of your choice at levels directed by you or an advisor—and you may even potentially receive tax benefits. These strategies can help teach stewardship to the next generation, allowing your children to participate as advisors. While your estate provides the finances, your children can determine and allocate funds using wise stewardship skills. This may be the ultimate inheritance—instilling the generosity of giving to the next generation.</p>\n<p>Whatever your decision, it’s critical to communicate it to your family. You may want to consult with your children—or choose to simply communicate your wishes after the decision has been made. Remember that above all else, it is your choice and your lasting legacy.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>In today’s litigious society, churches need to be proactive in risk management. Buying insurance is only one avenue for helping protect the church, its employees, its congregation and its reputation. A claim can be higher than your limit of insurance, a claim may not be covered, or a claim can even affect the attendance of the church. How you deal with these risks can make a difference in the longevity of the church.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Our goal is to help make your church safer by offering guidance to help you control your risk. As the area of church safety and risk management continues to grow in importance, we are committed to provide quarterly articles dealing with specific risks for churches, and ways to minimize risks to provide a safe environment for all. This quarter’s article will highlight things you should know in balancing safety with the fun of inflatable rentals.</p>\n<p>Churches continue to be a place of celebration, whether it’s an activity with members or a community outreach event. A common component to fun church events is the inflatable. Though they are popular with children as a fun activity, they pose a hazard for churches.</p>\n<p>As a general rule of thumb, you need to read the fine print from the rental company to make sure your church is not picking up all the liability.</p>\n<p><strong>Typical agreements hold rental companies harmless.</strong><br />\nA standard rental contract reads: Client agrees to indemnify and hold vendor harmless from any and all claim, actions, suits, proceedings, costs, expenses, fees, damages and liabilities, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, arising by reason of injury, damage or death to persons or property, in connection with or resulting from the use of leased equipment.</p>\n<p>Even though leasing companies usually provide staff to oversee bouncing houses, inflatable slides, or rock walls, if a child is injured, it’s typically the church—not the company—that is on the hook. Unless the church purchases a damage waiver, the same may be true if the equipment is damaged, no matter the cause. It is important to follow the guidelines for each inflatable, especially limits, capacity, and supervision requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>Ensure the rental company provides coverage for you.</strong><br />\nRequire the leasing company to name the church as an “additional named insured” and provide you with a certificate of insurance showing at least $1 million in coverage. If possible, invest extra money to get the leasing company to remove the “hold harmless” wording from the contract. Doing so will shift liability from the church back onto the leasing company. You may even get the vendor to give the church a “hold-harmless agreement.” Some vendors are reluctant to make such provisions in their contracts. If the company will not meet these requests, find one that will.</p>\n<p><strong>Authorized personnel must sign lease.</strong><br />\nOften, youth pastors are the ones who sign the lease agreement. Remember, only officers of your corporation are permitted to sign legal contracts. It is important that all church employees know who is authorized to sign contracts. However, the church may still be held liable, even if the contract is signed by someone who is unauthorized.</p>\n<p><strong>Some insurance companies specifically exclude coverage for inflatable equipment.</strong><br />\nCheck with your insurance provider to determine if you are protected. Failure to implement and follow the proper safety protocols could be disastrous for both the victim and the church.</p>\n<p>Inflatable equipment creates a lot of fun—and a lot of liability. If you have any risk management questions, or if we can assist your church in dealing with inflatables, please contact AGFinancial Insurance Solutions at 866.662.8210. We have a certified risk manager and attorney on staff to assist you.</p>\n<p>Jerry Sparks, President<br />\nAGFinancial Insurance Solutions<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:jsparks@agfinancialinsurance.org\">jsparks@agfinancialinsurance.org</a></p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

Before the next big storm hits, make sure you've adequately addressed the following cold weather hazards so you can protect your congregation and facilities.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Slips and falls</h2>\n<p>Winter can be the most high-risk season for slips and falls. To help prevent potential injuries, it's critical for churches to keep sidewalks and steps clear of ice and snow. Generously spread ice melt, salt, or sand on these areas. Inside, lay non-slip mats or rugs on tiled areas, especially near entry points to catch drips as people come and go. Clean up and place wet warning signs on any wet spots immediately.</p>\n<p>In most cases, if someone falls and gets hurt, the church's general liability policy will have medical payments coverage, but it is normally limited to $1,000, $5000 or $10,000. This is no-fault coverage and will pay automatically, whether there is liability on the church or not. However, if a slip or fall occurs because of some negligence, such as failing to clear a sidewalk of ice, the church could easily be held liable for the total claim. Numerous claims can be costly for a church, as insurance companies look at the number of claims as well as the total cost of claims.</p>\n<h2>Freezing pipes</h2>\n<p>This is one of the most common winter risks churches across the country face. In 2014, Church Mutual Insurance Company had more than 1,000 frozen pipe claims filed during one particular cold snap. The problem with a frozen pipe is that it can easily burst and cause severe water damage fast.</p>\n<p>The best way to prevent your pipes from freezing is to keep them warm. You can do that by maintaining a temperature of at least 55 degrees inside the building, even when it's not in use. Also, make sure attics and other areas where pipes run are adequately insulated. Exposed pipes may require insulating sleeves. In addition, it's recommended to check the building more often in the winter, to ensure the heating system is working and to be able to detect a burst pipe quickly before much damage occurs.</p>\n<h2>Snow accumulation</h2>\n<p>Churches in northern climates and areas that receive lots of snow face the potential for roof damage or even collapse. This happens when snow doesn't have adequate time to melt before more snow accumulates on top. You can help prevent the high cost of roof replacement by keeping gutters and downspouts clear. Inspect these routinely a few times a year to ensure they are free of leaves and other debris. For flat roofs, inspect drains to ensure they are not clogged. In general, performing routine roof maintenance during warm months and repairing leaks or damaged shingles quickly is the best way to prevent problems in the winter.</p>\n<p>For additional help getting your facilities ready for winter, download the free brochure from Church Mutual, <a href=\"https://www.churchmutual.com/179/Weather-Risks\">Weather Protection For Your Ministry</a>. It includes helpful checklists you can use to tour your facility and identify what additional work may be needed. With a little planning and preparation, you'll be ready when the weather outside turns frightful.</p>\n<p>To learn more about church liability insurance, call 866.621.1787 or email <a href=\"mailto:info@agfinancialinsurance.com\">info@agfinancialinsurance.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p><strong><em>Every once in a while, there is a COVID-19 communication written for the Church that really resonates. This is one of those times. Our friend, Jim Sheppard, Principal of Generis, wrote an insightful article about the coming times and the value of preparedness. We believe this is a message that the Church needs to hear now.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Written by Jim Sheppard</p>\n<p>I don't want to write this post. Everything in me wants to believe we are past this. I'm an irrepressible optimist and I want to believe we are past the financial effect of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>After all, the research ECFA released last week confirmed that most churches have fared well in this season. 66% of churches said their April 2020 giving was the same or higher than April 2019. 72% of churches said their April 2020 giving was the same or higher than January 2020. Amazing given the level of worldwide chaos we have experienced.</p>\n<p>Not only have churches fared well thus far, they are optimistic about the next 90 days. 69% of churches said they are optimistic about giving for the next three months (May-July).</p>\n<p>On top of that, the financial markets are doing well and have recovered a lot of the value that was lost in March and April.</p>\n<p><strong>I see that. And I also see warning signs on the horizon.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li> A new wave of layoffs is likely coming. Unemployment has increased dramatically and is now at a record level. It will take some time to get those people back to work. The expiration for the first PPP forgiveness period at the end of June will trigger some organizations to reassess head count now that the government subsidy has ended. Travel, tourism, restaurant, retail, hospitality, even healthcare will take time to recover. It is not out of the question that more unemployment could result in these sectors.</li>\n<li> Unless Congress authorizes additional support, many of the of the governmental supports that have been propping up the economy will expire.</li>\n<li> PPP funds and the reserves that created for churches may have helped in the April-June season but those funds will run out and churches will be faced with a new financial reality on July 1. While giving is good now, the Fall is a question mark.</li>\n<li> Many best givers have stepped up in March and April and have accelerated their giving to make sure their church has the funds to get through this season. Many of them may have already given their maximum gift for 2020, or at least most of it.</li>\n<li> What about the disease itself? Are we in for a new wave? The virus numbers are mixed this past week, June 15, reporting increases in half the states.</li>\n<li> Plans for many of the school systems, including colleges and universities, are up in the air. Many universities are telegraphing that they might be facing layoffs or furloughs.</li>\n<li> The consumer confidence level, a good leading indicator for congregational giving, has sharply declined from 132.6 in February. It is now at 86.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this leads an optimist like me to say what is hard to say. It is not over. At least not yet. It could be that all of these concerns are unfounded.</p>\n<p>However, if I were the CFO of a church, here is what I would be doing.</p>\n<p><strong>Build Reserves</strong></p>\n<p>In this season, think about creating as much financial margin as you can to weather a possible lean period through the Summer and into the Fall.</p>\n<p>Many churches have experienced reduced operating expenses in this season. Identify what those expenses are for your church. Put away all of the money you are saving on operating expenses.</p>\n<p>Pare expenses even further. This is the time to go through your 2020 budgets and pro formas and pare unnecessary operating costs as much as you can. Your world has changed dramatically since you adopted those budgets for this year. You have all the reason you need to re-examine even assumptions from 6 to 8 months ago. Identify additional expenses that can be pared and put all of that money into building up reserves.</p>\n<p><strong>Prepare For A Possible Downturn</strong></p>\n<p>As a former CFO of a public company, I am all about being prepared in case there is a downturn.</p>\n<p>Generally, I recommend three scenarios. For lack of a better naming convention, let's call them Scenarios A, B, and C. They represent the effects of mild, moderate, and severe giving shifts, respectively. Scenario C represents what you envision as your worst case. It is the most painful scenario to put together. However, what I have learned is that getting our scenarios in place allowed us to relax a little and make better decisions as the situation unfolded. In other words, we were not reacting to what happened, we were proactively setting a plan in motion based on what we had already decided. That is what I am recommending you do now. Develop your plans for each of the three scenarios. Then set them in motion based on how the situation unfolds. The reality is that we never had to resort to Plan C but we could lead with the confidence that we knew what we would do if that situation ever unfolded.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Scenario A</strong>, you would develop a financial plan around giving staying relatively close to where it has been historically. That might be a scenario for stable giving up to a decrease of say 10%. You would make mostly painless expense adjustments to the budget for the remainder of 2020. In all likelihood, staffing would not be affected in this scenario. That is, unless you know you are over staffed. This will be the easiest of the three scenarios to develop.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario B</strong> would anticipate a larger increment of decrease and a different level of planning. For the purposes of this example, let’s say that is your scenario for a giving decrease of 15-25%. If you were a church that has developed reserves over the years, and we certainly recommend that, this would be a time for you to consider how much of those reserves would be deployed to make up for the shortfall in giving, particularly if you thought the shortfall was not going to be long-term but you need to plan for it in the coming 2 to 6 months. This scenario generally involves getting beyond superficial cuts and moving into a more significant expense realignment.</p>\n<p>That could mean staffing. I urge churches to be careful before you put into place any staffing shifts, because moves like this always cause a reverberation in the congregation. It can signal instability and financial concern at a time when you least need for people to feel that. So, in addition to making the financial moves that you need to make, you will also have to decide how to message this to your people in a way that projects confidence in the church and its leaders.</p>\n<p>Scenario C is the plan for a severe giving decrease that you see lasting beyond this season. Let’s say there is a decrease in giving of 30% or more. It is the most painful scenario to develop because it involves a complete re-thinking of your entire model of how you do church. It will entail significant shifts in staffing, which are difficult for any organization and even more so for a church. But you will have to do it if your financial reality is such that you cannot continue to fund your current staffing model.</p>\n<p><strong>In Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>I am very optimistic about church finances once we get on the other side of this season. Like you, I want it to be over…sooner, not later. I’m the “glass more than half full\" guy, so my tendency is to lean that way. In our current situation, however, I am not fully confident we are out of the woods on this. I want to be wrong. But, for now, let me just say again…it’s not over.

The five steps below can help you improve your church finance knowledge and preparedness.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Review the budget</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Budget planning is essential to good church financial management. A budget provides a way to track income and expenses, providing you with the information necessary for making strong financial decisions. A properly planned budget will help you maintain and possibly even increase cash flow by keeping expenses within the church’s income.</p>\n<p>Our most popular tool is the <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/church-budget-template/\">Church Budget Template</a>. Download it to help identify areas your church may be able to improve.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Build an emergency fund</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Every church needs an emergency fund of at least three to six months of operating expenses. The best way to build it is to make saving part of the budget. It’s recommended to allocate 5-10% of income toward cash reserves. Then once you’ve built your emergency fund, you can begin saving toward ministry goals.</p>\n<p>Investing is a great way to maintain and grow your ministry’s cash reserve. Many churches choose to invest in church extension funds, such as AGFinancial.</p>\n<p>View the <a href=\"/investments/types-of-investments/\">AGFinancial Offering Circular</a> for more information.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> Assess risk management strategies</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Poor risk management is a leading cause of serious financial loss for churches. No matter the size of your church, it’s a good idea to appoint a risk management leader or team. These individuals can be tasked with assessing the areas of risk your ministry faces and then implementing measures and policies to minimize them.</p>\n<p>Learn exactly how to minimize risk with the <a href=\"/insurance/church-risk-management-guide-ebook/\">AGFinancial Insurance Solutions Risk Management Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>To stay up to date on the latest issues that could affect your ministry from a risk standpoint, tune in to <a href=\"/insurance/risk-management/riskmgmtlive/\">Risk Mgmt LIVE</a> each month.

Your church’s needs can change over time. If you’ve recently begun new ministry ventures, added a daycare or school, or made other significant changes, you’ll need to make sure that your coverage is adequate to protect your ministry in case of a loss. In addition, you may be able to find better coverage at a lower cost by comparison shopping.</p>\n<p>Learn recommended coverage types and amounts with the <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/church-insurance-guide/\">Church Insurance Guide</a>.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong> Celebrate progress and plan the future</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Spring symbolizes renewal and hope for the future.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>As the holidays draw near, it’s time to consider year-end planning options. Just as an annual physical is important for monitoring your physical health, an annual financial assessment is an ideal way to monitor your financial health and provide the opportunity to make adjustments before the December 31 deadline.</p>\n<p>The Thanksgiving holiday is a great time to sit down and analyze your financial situation and implement a plan to make sure you are on target with your goals. Following are several options to consider:</p>\n<p><strong>Charitable Gifts</strong></p>\n<p>A number of tax-advantaged options are available for those wanting to make year-end contributions. Consider the following options for making a charitable donation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cash<br /> Cash contributions can usually be completed quickly right up to year-end. A popular option for those wanting to give cash is a <a href=\"/blog/bid107913planned-giving-101-donor-advised-funds/\">Donor Advised Fund</a> (DAF). It’s a convenient option with no cost to set up and minimal paperwork. With a DAF, you advise how and when funds are distributed to ministry. <br /> Another option for cash funding is a <a href=\"/planned-giving/planned-giving-tools/gift-annuities/\">Gift Annuity</a>, which can provide fixed income for your family and the opportunity to support ministry with the remainder. By funding with cash, a significant portion of the income from the annuity may be tax-free.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciated Stock<br /> Giving appreciated stock is an ideal way of making a gift to ministry because the ministry will be able to use the value of the gift now, and you may be able to avoid the imposition of capital gains tax on the gift. Learn more about the value of giving appreciated stock. In addition to funding a <a href=\"/planned-giving/planned-giving-tools/gift-annuities/\">Gift Annuity</a>, appreciated stock can also fund a <a href=\"/planned-giving/planned-giving-tools/charitable-remainder-trusts/\">Charitable Remainder Trust</a>. This type of trust is designed to offer immediate tax benefits and allow your family to receive income for a period of time, after which the remainder of the principal is transferred to a ministry of your choice.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciated Real Estate<br /> By gifting appreciated real estate, the ministry of your choice will be able to sell it and enjoy the full proceeds, while you will be able to avoid capital gains tax. Real estate may be used to fund a variety of giving vehicles including Charitable Remainder Trusts, <a href=\"/blog/bid107913planned-giving-101-donor-advised-funds/\">Donor Advised Funds</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid107913planned-giving-101-donor-advised-funds/\">Endowments</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Family Gifts</strong></p>\n<p>If your circumstances allow you to start transferring some of your assets to your children and grandchildren now, consider making annual exemptions gifts. For 2016, the IRS allows a person to give a total of $14,000 to any number of recipients free from any gift tax. This means a husband and wife can transfer $28,000 (two $14,000 gifts) to the same individual or several people.</p>\n<p><strong>Adjust Capital Gains and Losses</strong></p>\n<p>If you have had gains on capital items in your investment portfolio, you may be able to make adjustments before the end of the year to lower or eliminate your tax liability for net capital gains. This is done by selling underperforming investments to help offset the total gains you received, thereby lowering your taxable net capital gain amount.</p>\n<p><strong>Manipulating Income and Deductions</strong></p>\n<p>Depending on your circumstances, you may be able to time your income and deductions to maximum tax advantage. Common examples would be delaying the receipt of a year-end bonus until 2017 or paying some 2017 deductible expenses by year-end. The goal is to offset income with expenses to minimize tax liability.</p>\n<p><strong>Contributions to Retirement Plans</strong></p>\n<p>Increase or maximize your contributions to qualified retirement plans [IRA, 401(k) and 403(b)], especially if your employer has a matching program. Employer matching programs provide free money, which adds immediately to the investment return. If you are age 50 or older, take advantage of available catch-up contributions.</p>\n<p><strong>Charitable IRA Distribution for 2016</strong></p>\n<p>For those IRA owners aged 70½, all or a portion of your <a href=\"/retirement-planning/faqs/\">required minimum distribution </a>(RMD) can be used to make charitable distributions of up to $100,000 to qualified 501©(3) charities, bypassing the taxation of the distribution. An endowment would also qualify to receive a charitable IRA distribution for perpetual giving to a ministry or cause of your choice.</p>\n<p>If you would like assistance implementing some of these ideas or developing a year-end giving strategy specific to your situation, please call 866.945.6350 to speak to an AGFinancial Planned Giving Consultant.</p>\n<p><strong>Related article: <a href=\"/blog/charitable-gifts-promote-generosity-provide-tax-benefits/\">Charitable Gifts Promote Generosity &amp; Provide Tax Benefits</a></strong></p>\n</p>\n<p><em>This information is not legal or tax advice.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <div>\n<p>Shopping for a church loan can be a big undertaking. Most people are familiar with residential mortgages, but a church requires a commercial mortgage, and with that comes different guidelines to follow. Consider the following best-practice recommendations when shopping for a church loan:</p>\n<p><strong>Understand what interest rate terms may mean for you.</strong><br /> Many banks refer to balloon notes as “fixed rate loans.” This is somewhat misleading. While “fixed rate” has a positive connotation in the residential market when the loan term is 15 or 30 years, on a 5-year balloon commercial note, the rate is only fixed for the 5-year term. The benefit of an adjustable rate loan in the commercial mortgage market is that you know up front how high your rate is allowed to go. Plus, the loan is guaranteed to remain until you pay off the entire balance. If your church currently has a balloon note, fill out our <a href=\"/church-loans/calculators/\">Mortgage Risk Evaluation</a> tool to identify potential areas of improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t borrow more than you can afford.</strong><br /> Only consider your tithes and offering income when determining how much your church can afford to borrow. Designated income, such as missions and benevolence, should not be used to pay your mortgage.</p>\n<p><strong>Borrow for the longest period possible.</strong><br /> Having a longer amortization schedule (and therefore lower payments) can give you the flexibility in your budget for cash flow fluctuation. No matter how accurate your projection, some months your income will be lower than others. Don’t let ministry stability suffer because you’re committed to a larger loan payment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pay off your loan as quickly as possible.</strong><br /> Some months your income may be higher than expected. Use that extra cash to pay down your debt. As you shop for loans, make sure you don’t have a prepayment penalty so that you can take every opportunity to make extra principal payments on your loan and save your ministry money on interest in the long run.</p>\n<p><strong>Mitigate the long-term risks to your ministry.</strong><br /> It is important that we are wise stewards of the ministry and resources God has entrusted to us. You can’t afford to look at the future of your ministry in 5-year increments. To avoid incurring the costs and risks of refinancing every few years, look for a loan with a longer term rather than a shorter term. Learn more about avoiding risk with your mortgage by reading “<a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid98062what-is-your-church-loan-really-costing-you/?mobile=true\">What is Your Church Loan Really Costing You?</a>”</p>\n<p><strong>Talk to a direct lender that understands ministry.</strong><br /> Working with a direct lender instead of a mortgage broker can help you avoid unnecessary broker fees. In addition, a direct lender that has a strong understanding of church ministry will be more aware of growth trends, ebbs and flows, and the needs of a growing church. This is beneficial for the church throughout the entire relationship with the financial institution.</p>\n<p>As you search for the loan solution that is best for your ministry, contact us to discuss your options.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Many investors rely on a fixed income while juggling fluctuating interest rates. Due to the current low interest rate environment, this can prove to be quite challenging. An easy and effective investment approach, referred to as laddering, may lead to enhanced returns and help avoid significant income loss due to changes in interest rates.</p>\n<p>A laddered investment approach is based on allocating portions of your total investment and staggering maturity dates so that each portion of your portfolio matures at regular intervals. Each rung of the ladder represents a specific maturity date. The more “rungs” you have the more you reduce your exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and thus potentially earn higher than average yields. Laddering allows you to receive the benefit of earning the higher interest rates of longer term investments while still enjoying some liquidity.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example of how laddering can work: Rather than investing $60,000 for a one-year period and renewing each year at the often lower one-year rate, you could create a three-year ladder and put $20,000 in a one-year investment, $20,000 in a two-year investment, and $20,000 in a three-year maturity at probable higher interest rates. After the first year, you would take the maturing one-year investment and purchase a new three-year investment. After the second year, the initial two-year investment matures and you would purchase a new three-year investment. Do the same with the initial three-year investment. Starting in year four, all of your investments will be earning the higher three-year rate. Additionally, you would have access to a third of your principal as it matures each year.</p>\n<p>Using this laddered approach, you may achieve more consistent returns over the long term, even if interest rates fluctuate.</p>\n<p>To learn more about laddering and how it can work for you, call toll-free at <strong>866.621.1787</strong> to speak to an AGFinancial investment consultant. Together, we can customize a laddering strategy that best fits your needs and goals.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Voltaire, the famous 17<sup>th</sup> century writer and philosopher, once said, “Judge a man by his questions rather than his answers.” Nobody has the answers to everything in life, but knowing what questions to ask can often help you find what you’re looking for.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Here are a few questions to keep in mind as you start the loan process:</p>\n<h2><strong>Ask yourself</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Can your church service a loan?<br /></strong>This may be the most important question you can ask, and there are many aspects to consider. Does your church own land or other assets that can be used as collateral? Do the income statements show consistent growth with enough cash flow to service a mortgage payment? If purchasing a building or entering a construction project, does the church have enough cash on hand to put toward the cost? Do your research and know what you can afford before moving forward on a new building project or purchase.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does your church need additional space?<br /></strong>A sad truth is there are some pastors who want additional space to fulfill their personal visions of what they want their church to be. However, it’s important to take a step back and see what God’s vision for your church is and how the ministry has naturally grown. Expanding and adding facilities can be exciting, but it’s important not to let yourself get ahead of God’s timeline and to make sure your investment will have a return in terms of growing His Kingdom.</p>\n<p><strong>Does your church have stable leadership?<br /></strong>The relationship with your lender is a two-way street. Much like you want to know your lender will still be there in a few years, your lender wants to know the same thing about your church. If you know your church will be undergoing a major transition in leadership within the next couple years, now may not be the right time to start shopping around for loans.</p>\n<p><strong>Does your church have equity in its current property?<br /></strong>Equity is the difference between the value of your church’s property and the amount of outstanding debt. As the amount of equity increases, so does the likelihood of qualifying for a loan.</p>\n<h2><strong>Ask your lender</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>How much can I afford to borrow?<br /></strong>This question should be a top priority as it could drastically change the scope of your project. If you’re planning on a multi-million dollar facility, hearing that you can only afford to borrow a few hundred thousand dollars will probably cause you to rethink your project. This isn’t always a comfortable question to ask, but it’s imperative to ask it before your plans start writing checks your funds can’t afford.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your experience in church loans?<br /></strong>Your lender will be your partner for years—maybe even decades. Having a lender who understands the church lending process can save you headaches, time, and cost in the long run. Dr. Richard Hammar, attorney and CPA specializing in church law and taxes, said in a recent article “Ministers' taxes aren’t complex; they’re unique.” The same can be said about church loans. From the vernacular to the planning, church loans are unlike other commercial loans, and having a lender that understands that can be a great asset.</p>\n<p><strong>What happens to the interest paid on my loan?<br /></strong>Sometimes lenders will use their profits to fund political or social causes you may not feel comfortable having your church affiliated with. Many pastors have found comfort in working with a lender that specializes in lending to churches as they understand this concern.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you offer permanent financing for churches?<br /></strong>In the world of commercial lending, it’s not uncommon to find loans mislabeled as “fixed” or “permanent.” Sometimes “fixed” rates are carried out as short-term balloon notes that have enticing interest rates and a noteworthy disclaimer: at the end of the term, the remaining amount must be paid as a lump sum. A true permanent loan is a stable arrangement that provides less financial risk to the church.</p>\n<p>Since not all pastors are experts in the area of commercial loans, asking yourself and your potential lender these questions can save time and money. To explore financing options with a lender that specializes in church loans, call 866.621.1787 to speak to one of our loan consultants.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>On December 16, 2015, the Federal Reserve raised the targeted Fed Funds rate by 0.25 percent, and within minutes banks took action. Wells Fargo was the first to announce their plan to increase their prime-lending rate. U.S. Bancorp, JPMorgan, Chase, M&amp;T, and PNC quickly followed suit. Despite the immediate response to increased lending rates, these same banks promptly stated their deposit rates would remain unchanged.</p>\n<p>In 2004, when the Federal Reserve last began to raise the target rate, the initial increase of 0.25 percent was followed by 16 additional rate increases over a 2-year span. The impact on deposit rates was slow. Similarly, many experts believe it will take several more interest rate hikes before savers see any meaningful impact on their interest rates.</p>\n<p>Interest rates are affected by more than just the target rate. Rates on bank deposits, CDs, money markets, etc., are largely dependent on overall lending demand and the banks’ need to attract additional cash. Currently, banks don’t need additional cash as they have an unprecedented amount available to lend due to years of stimulus by the central bank. That means the delay in increased deposit rates will probably be longer than it was in 2004.</p>\n<p>Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has indicated that interest rates will only rise if further improvement in the overall economy warrants an increase. With the Federal Reserve’s current commitment to their accommodative monetary policy, banks will continue to have more than enough liquidity and will not need to raise deposit rates as quickly as other rates may rise.</p>\n<p>Since the end of the Great Recession (2008- 2009), investors have sought safety with their investments. Bank deposits have grown an average of 6% annually since 2009. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., US bank deposits now total approximately $10.6 trillion. While bank deposits have grown, interest rates have remained at all-time lows.</p>\n<p>The average interest rate on many money market accounts is 0.1 percent. Retirement product rates such as the 3-year GIC (Guaranteed Investment Certificate) are still approximately 1.50 percent, highlighting the lack of correlation between a typical retirement product and the recent move in the Fed Funds target rate.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>For six decades, the MBA Income Fund has weathered many different interest rate environments. The flexibility to adjust rates based on careful analysis has allowed the MBA Income Fund to continue to thrive. In 2015, the 403(b) plan added over 1,400 new enrollments and the MBA Income Fund added $40 million in balance sheet growth. It continues to provide stability at a premium rate for our participants.</p>\n<p>In addition to the MBA Income Fund, we are pleased to offer a variety of investment options for participants who are willing to take additional risk for potentially higher returns. One of these options is the Steward Funds. These faith-based funds align with your values by providing a screened indexed approach, avoiding investments in companies that derive a significant portion of their revenue from abortion, pornography, alcohol, tobacco, and gambling. The award-winning Steward Global Equity Income Fund Institutional Class is included in this family of funds and was the recipient of the 2015 Thomson Reuters Lipper Fund Award. The award recognizes funds that deliver consistently strong risk-adjusted performance relative to its peers.</p>\n<p>With interest rates expected to remain at historical lows, the MBA Income Fund rate remains at a significant premium to similar retirement products in the market.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Meet Jim*. Several years ago, he invested money for himself and his wife, Bonnie, in a bank CD, but Bonnie passed away before it matured.</p>\n<p>Jim and Bonnie had always been active church members. Bonnie served for years as a Sunday school teacher. When the CD matured, Jim decided he wanted to honor her with a gift to their church. He also needed money to live on. He feared he wouldn't be able to give as much to the church as he hoped.</p>\n<p>The solution? A <a href=\"/blog/bid88295planned-giving-through-charitable-gift-annuities/\" rel=\"noopener\">Charitable Gift Annuity</a>.</p>\n<h4><strong>How does it work?</strong></h4>\n<p>A Charitable Gift Annuity is a planned giving tool by which you can transfer cash, stock, or other appreciated assets to a charity and receive both <strong>tax benefits</strong> and <strong>fixed payments </strong>during your lifetime. Upon your death, the remainder goes to the organization. Assemblies of God Foundation allows you to designate a portion of the remainder to any ministry of your choice, including your local church.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://media.agfinancial.org/giftannuitygraphic.jpg?mtime=20200602234751&focal=none\" alt=\"giftannuitygraphic\" data-image=\"seqb63fj8wgo\" width=\"700\" height=\"389\"></figure>\n<p>Jim discovered he could receive an income stream of 7.2% from his Charitable Gift Annuity based on his age. In addition to this fixed payment, he could also receive a charitable income tax deduction. He decided to transfer $100,000 from the CD to AG Foundation to create the annuity and has been pleased.</p>\n<p>\"The gift annuity was a good decision. I know it's something that would have pleased Bonnie. And it's a blessing to me also. I'm saving thousands in income taxes, and the income I'm receiving is dependable and more than I was getting from my CD.\"</p>\n<h4><strong>Who benefits most from a Charitable Gift Annuity?</strong></h4>\n<p>A Charitable Gift Annuity may be an ideal solution if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are over age 70</li>\n<li>Want a dependable lifetime income for you and/or your spouse</li>\n<li>Wish to convert a low-interest investment (CD, savings account) into lifetime income</li>\n<li>Want to realize tax savings and avoid upfront capital gains on appreciated assets, like stocks</li>\n<li>Wish to leave a charitable gift</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>How do the tax benefits work?</strong></h4>\n<p>With a Charitable Gift Annuity, you are transferring the asset to an organization as a gift. The potential tax benefits can be two-fold, including both a charitable tax deduction and a partial bypass of capital gains taxes on appreciated assets. Upon transferring the asset, you are eligible for an immediate tax deduction. As for capital gains tax, for example when dealing with appreciated stocks, the tax would be based on the difference between the original cost of the stock and its current value. If you were to simply sell the stock, you would pay federal, and in most cases, state capital gains taxes. But by transferring the stock as part of a Charitable Gift Annuity, it’s possible to avoid upfront payment of those taxes and, depending on the situation, possibly bypass a portion of those taxes completely.</p>\n<h4><strong>I don't have much money set aside. Can I still set one up?</strong></h4>\n<p>Yes. Compared to other types of giving vehicles, Charitable Gift Annuities have a relatively low funding minimum of $10,000, making them a popular option for those with fewer assets.</p>\n<p>To find out if a Charitable Gift Annuity could work for you, call <strong>866.621.1787</strong> or <a href=\"mailto:plannedgiving@agfinancial.org\">email us</a>, and one of our planned giving consultants will contact you shortly.</p>\n</p>\n<p><em>*This example is based on a hypothetical fact scenario and is intended for illustration purposes only. The terms, tax benefits, and expected income are dependent on several variables that are different in each situation. Consult your tax advisor for more information that is specific to your situation. Upon the death of the annuitant or the survivor of the annuitants, payments will cease. At that time, one-half of the reminder will be retained in the fit annuity fund to ensure the ongoing financial strength of the gift annuity program, and the other one-half of the remainder will be released to Assemblies of God Foundation for ministry benefit. If undesignated, the released portion will be placed in the Foundation endowment fund, and the specific ministry to benefit each year will be decided by the Executive Presbytery based upon where it is most needed.<br />\nCharitable Gift Annuities are available in most states, but there are a few exceptions. Depending upon the laws of the state in which you live, your Assemblies of God Charitable Gift Annuity will be issued by the General Council of the Assemblies of God or Assemblies of God Foundation and will be a general obligation of the issuing organization.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Fraud can occur at any organization, but churches are extremely susceptible due to their trusting nature. Church leaders are responsible to God and to their congregation to safeguard the ministry's assets. To do so, there are a few things every pastor should understand about fraud.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>It CAN happen to you.</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, churches experience fraud to nearly the same extent that secular organizations do. The potential for fraud must be taken seriously. It can go undetected for months or even years. Then, when fraud is discovered, churches often decide not to report it to the police to prevent bad publicity.</p>\n<h3>What is fraud?</h3>\n<p>Fraud is an intentional deception made against an individual or organization for personal gain. If the right set of circumstances is present, it can occur at any organization, at any time, by any individual. While there are many types of fraud, churches most often experience embezzlement, defined as the fraudulent appropriation of money or property for one’s own use. No organization — including a church — is automatically exempt from this fraudulent behavior.</p>\n<h3>What causes fraud?</h3>\n<p>Three elements are often needed for fraud to occur. This is called the <strong><em>fraud triangle</em></strong>. The first element is <strong>pressure</strong> on an individual to steal. Pressure may come in many forms — medical bills, addiction problems, greed, excessive debt, and lavish lifestyles, to name a few. To assume a Christian would not be susceptible to any of these may be naïve. Even the strongest Christians can fail if the pressure is great enough and they take their eyes off Christ. In fact, personal financial trouble is the main reason people steal at work. Because of this, it's a good idea to run credit reports on new hires.</p>\n<p>A second element is <strong>rationalization</strong>. Rationalization occurs when a typically honest person makes excuses to commit fraud. Many times the individual will justify the theft by calling it something else. They may rationalize that the money really is owed to them and so they will take what is coming to them. Other times, a person may want to borrow some money from the church, but does not want the embarrassment of asking for a loan. They rationalize, “It’s just a loan. I will pay it back as soon as I can.” Rarely is the money repaid. Instead, the fraud tends to accelerate as the person gains confidence from getting away with it.</p>\n<p>The third element is <strong>opportunity</strong>. This is the only part of the triangle an organization can control, but it is the one many churches ignore.</p>\n<p>Churches try to foster an atmosphere of trust and forgiveness because they do not want any brother or sister in Christ to feel they are not trusted. Unfortunately, this often means too much leeway is given, providing the very opportunity a fraudster needs in order to commit a theft. A church should proactively develop <em>internal controls</em> to prevent undesirable acts against the church.</p>\n<h3 >Proper safeguards can prevent fraud from taking place.</h3>\n<p>By following recommended prevention methods, the risk of fraud happening can be drastically reduced. Having safeguards in place demonstrates a church is serious about being a good steward of God’s money. Some procedures can be implemented to help prevent any one person from having the opportunity to commit a fraud. These are <em>internal controls</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Segregation of duties and transaction authorization</strong>. Make sure more than one person is responsible for the collection of the offerings, counting the money, depositing the money in the bank, and reconciling bank statements. Although segregation of duties can sometimes be difficult with a small staff, it’s crucial to have at minimum a second individual to help perform duties. Church Mutual Insurance Company, America’s leading church insurer and partner of AGFinancial, recommends the following:\n<ul>\n<li>Two individuals should be required to sign larger checks, more than $1,000 for instance. All major purchases should require approval by the board and/or congregation. It’s not recommended to use stamps with the pastor’s signature.</li>\n<li>Transfer of large sums into or out of different accounts should not be permitted without written consent of two people.</li>\n<li>Banks statements and other statements of accounts should be verified independently of the person(s) who have check-writing or other account authority.</li>\n<li>Create a standardized form to document any cash handling, requiring all cash withdrawals to have two signatures.</li>\n<li>Do not allow the same person to count the offering each week. Set up a rotation of two or more different individuals each Sunday.</li>\n<li>Deposit cash as soon as possible after services, using your bank’s night depository. If none is available, use a safe. Stamp checks “For Deposit Only.” Cash should never go to anyone’s home.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Physical safeguards</strong>. It's a good idea to stow petty cash in a safe. Establish a procedure for its use and disbursement, minimizing access and treating it like a bank account with regular audits and reports. In addition, limit the handing out of church credit cards. To increase building security, assign a unique code to each church employee for keypad entrances. Establish a procedure for the use, distribution, and collection of keys. Keep a list of who is given a key, when, and for what activity. Also consider posting security cameras in both conspicuous and hidden areas.</li>\n<li><strong>Annual CPA reviews or audits</strong>. These can be expensive, but not detecting fraud is far more costly. Present the results to your governing body. Prepare and review monthly reports as well. At a minimum, engage a CPA firm to perform reviews of high fraud risk areas such as cash management and assessments of internal controls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What to do if fraud occurs:</h3>\n<p>If you suspect fraud within your church, do not share this information with anyone involved in the process. Remember, the fraudster can be the most trusted member of your staff. Instead, talk to a local accounting firm that has an audit department and they will tell you what your next steps should be. If fraud has occurred, the best response is to involve the police. Although churches are often reluctant to do this, studies show that once a person has committed a fraud, they rarely stop on their own. If they simply get fired, they will likely go on to other organizations and commit the same crime. If the individual is prosecuted and convicted, the facts of the case become public knowledge, offering several benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Experiencing consequences may help the person stop committing fraud.</li>\n<li>Reporting the crime gives the church an opportunity to recover some of what was stolen. In fact, insurance companies usually require prosecution to take place for a church to be able to collect coverage on stolen goods.</li>\n<li>The church will be allowed to warn other employers of the fraudster. If they are not prosecuted, you will not be able to inform their next employer of the reason they were fired, and the cycle could continue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about how to protect your church from fraud and other hazards, call <strong>866.621.1787</strong>to speak to a church insurance consultant.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>For many, financial strategies are a mystical or magical potion better left to those with acronyms behind their name. Although seeking the advice of a licensed financial professional may be a wise decision, and necessary depending upon the complexity of your finances, you can create and implement some basic strategies yourself. These strategies are simply a plan to prioritize and allocate your resources to meet desired and established financial goals. I’ve grouped these strategies into five steps: establishing your goals, planning for taxes, creating your budget, living within your budget, and evaluating your budget regularly.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>The Big Picture</h3>\n<p>Before you put a pencil to your budget, take some time to really think about and <strong>define your financial goals</strong>. These goals will shape your budget and can be categorized as short-term or long-term. <strong>Short-term goals</strong> are financial goals that you want or need to achieve within the next twelve months or less. Common short-term financial goals include saving for a vacation, eliminating credit card debt, saving for a major appliance that needs to be replaced, and other similar events. List out these goals, as you will need to build these commitments into your budget. <strong>Long-term financial goals</strong>, those that will take greater than twelve months to achieve, will also be built into your budget. Possibly the most important long-term goal is saving for retirement. Use the best vehicles available as you establish your retirement goals, whether it is a 401(k) or 403(b) plan with your employer, an IRA, or a host of other options. Other long-term goals may include a college savings plan, paying off your mortgage, or building up an investment portfolio. Take time to consider these long-term commitments, and then break them down into monthly allocations to be included in your budget.</p>\n<h3>Factor in Taxes</h3>\n<p>Now it’s time to <strong>do a little tax planning</strong>. First, you want to be sure that you are withholding enough taxes so that you don’t have an unexpected tax bill at the end of the year. On the other hand, you really don’t want to receive a huge refund. Too much tax withholding can needlessly restrict your cash flow and extend the amount of time it will take to attain your financial goals. No one has ever received an interest check from the IRS along with a refund of their overpaid taxes. If you don’t need the funds for monthly expenses, take those “excess” funds and put them to work in your budget. Accelerate the accomplishment of a goal or goals, increase your retirement investment, or simply save more in your own interest-bearing savings account.</p>\n<h3>Put Pencil to Paper</h3>\n<p>Now that your goals are set and you have a good idea of your take-home pay (income after taxes, benefits, etc.), it is time to create your budget. There are numerous <strong>personal budgeting tools</strong> available to you, both in print and online. Take advantage of these. They will walk you through the budgeting process, offer advice, and help ensure that the budget you produce is all-inclusive and complete. While there are many others, Dave Ramsey and Crown Financial offer two of the most popular personal budgeting tools.</p>\n<p>Creating your initial budget can be challenging. Don’t expect it to be perfect on your first try. Instead, use it as a template and revisit it each month. As you prepare your budget, include your net cash inflows (take-home pay) and all outflows (expenses) such as tithes, mortgage, utilities, wireless and cable, auto loan, food, entertainment, etc. Don’t leave anything out. If in doubt, include it. It is always better to be pleasantly surprised than to exceed your budget.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve completed the first draft of your budget, step back to see where your funds are going and if there is an opportunity to save. Review your monthly fixed costs like service fees and insurance premiums. Can you get the same coverage for less cost? Do you have the best cable/wireless plan for you and your family? Can any debt you are carrying be refinanced or consolidated at a lower cost? You may be amazed how much can be saved by honestly reviewing, cutting or optimizing your monthly commitments.</p>\n<h3>Follow the Blueprint</h3>\n<p>Once you have finalized your budget, the challenging part begins. It’s time to live within your budget. I’m reminded of a popular episode of <em>Seinfeld</em> where Jerry and Elaine are at the car rental counter in a dispute with the desk clerk. She has his reservation, but the car he reserved is not available. After the clerk states, “I know how a reservation works.” Jerry, using copious amounts of body language, responds, “I don’t think you do. Anyone can take a reservation, the important part is to hold the reservation.” So it is with your budget. Anyone can create a budget. The important part is holding to your budget. It’s not simply a brain exercise or even a benchmark to shoot for. Instead, it is the blueprint for achieving your financial goals. Of course there are times when unforeseen events and expenses arise that may bust your monthly budget. If this occurs, regroup and get back to your budget immediately. Don’t become discouraged and discard your budget. Determine if you can make changes to prevent the same thing from happening again, and then press on.</p>\n<h3>Update Annually</h3>\n<p>Finally, review, evaluate, and update your budget on a regular basis (at least annually). When changes impact your financial “big picture,” update your budget accordingly. It’s also good to revisit recurring charges or fixed expenses regularly. Shop competitors against each other for items like insurance, wireless plans, Internet service, and cable or satellite service, to name just a few. This is also an opportune time to revisit your goals. Did you achieve your short-term goals? What are your new short-term goals? How are you progressing towards your long-term goals? Have your goals changed? Consider these questions and then make the necessary changes to your budget.</p>\n<p>Some financial strategies can be quite complex. Yet everyone can begin with the most basic of financial strategies: a budget. Set your goals, create a budget around your goals, live according to that budget, and then reevaluate your budget on a regular basis. With a little practice and self-discipline, you can become comfortable with the budgeting process, giving yourself the opportunity to achieve your financial dreams.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some financial strategies that work for you? </strong>Add your comments below.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

We can help you accomplish that.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Set a Goal.</h2>\n<p>Pinpointing a clear savings goal is key to reaching it. The more specific your goal can be, the better. Many people have an idea of what they’d like to save for, but consider adding the following to your list if they’re not already there.</p>\n<h4>Emergencies</h4>\n<p>This should be your first savings goal because it’s a cushion against the inevitable emergencies of life, such as car repairs and medical bills. Experts recommend an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses in case of a loss of income.</p>\n<h4>Retirement</h4>\n<p>Increasing your retirement contributions for 2018 is an excellent goal. For 2018, the maximum you may contribute to a 403(b) is $18,500 if you are under age 50. If you are 50 or older, you may contribute an additional $6,000. For IRAs, the maximum contribution for 2015 is $5,500 if you are under age 50. Those 50 or older may contribute $6,500.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/retirement-planning/403b/\" rel=\"noopener\">Take advantage of AGFinancial's retirement savings options.</a></p>\n<h4>Purchases</h4>\n<p>Eventually everyone will make large purchases, such as a car, new refrigerator, or other desired item. Rather than assuming you’ll have to finance these things, make saving for them a priority. By proactively planning and saving, you can minimize or eliminate the possibility of future debt.</p>\n<h2>Make a Plan.</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve decided on your savings goals and how much you’ll need, it’s time to make a plan. For instance, if your goal is to save $3,000 for emergencies, decide how much money you’re able to set aside out of each paycheck and then calculate how long it will take to reach your goal. This gives you a time frame for reaching your goal and can help you stay motivated.</p>\n<p>Many people have multiple things they’re saving for simultaneously. In this case, it helps to prioritize your goals and set aside money out of each paycheck accordingly. If you need to build your emergency fund, save for retirement, and save for a car, then divide your savings amounts from each paycheck with the largest amount going toward the most important goal, then a smaller amount to the next goal, and so on. You may need to cut back spending in other areas, but a little discipline goes a long way to help you reach your savings goals.</p>\n<h2>Save Automatically.</h2>\n<p>This is an effective way to save for one simple reason—it removes YOU from the equation. By saving automatically, you won’t risk being tempted to use that money for other things and sabotage your own efforts.</p>\n<p>If you have not yet set up automatic paycheck deductions for savings, <a href=\"http://www.americasavesweek.org\" rel=\"noopener\">America Saves Week</a> is the perfect time to do so. While you’re at it, go ahead and establish automatic contributions for your retirement account(s). Don’t be discouraged if the amounts are small. You’ll be surprised how quickly it adds up.</p>\n<p>If you are trying to save for an emergency fund, an upcoming purchase, or even a special vacation, AGFinancial is here to help.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>While <a title=\"property insurance\" href=\"/blog/bid86683understanding-church-insurance-property-coverage/\" target=\"_self\">property insurance</a> covers the things you own, liability insurance covers the actions that could leave your church liable for damage to others (injuries, property, or reputation). Many ministries wonder what type of liability insurance they need for their organization. Churches have become increasingly susceptible to lawsuits and claims for false accusations or inappropriate behavior. If someone claims any level of harm, you will want coverage to fall back on. Optional coverages are available for a wide variety of risks. Discuss all the aspects of your ministry and any possible exposures with your agent so that you can obtain proper protection. Below are some of the available types of liability coverage.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>General liability.</strong> Liability comes into play when the church is legally liable for bodily injury or property damage. In addition to paying the damages for the injured party, the policy usually covers defense costs for litigation. It is recommended that churches carry at least $1 million in general liability coverage.</li>\n<li><strong>Sexual misconduct liability.</strong> Not only is it wise to have coverage for a real incident but also to defend against an allegation. Defense costs can climb into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The amount paid to the plaintiff is often substantial and can force a church into bankruptcy or liquidation. It is recommended that a church has a minimum of $250,000 and should strive to obtain higher limits if at all possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Directors and officers liability.</strong> This is coverage for decisions made by your board, officers, or trustees. Even though many states offer protection for volunteer board members of nonprofit organizations, there can still be significant defense costs should someone bring legal action against board members.</li>\n<li><strong>Employment practices liability.</strong> This coverage provides for claims arising from practices associated with employment-related events. This includes claims of discrimination, wrongful termination, etc. The premium cost for this item is usually less than only a few hours of attorney fees. We are seeing more claims in this area due to age or gender discrimination.</li>\n<li><strong>Employee benefits liability.</strong> This coverage provides for claims arising from an error or omission by an employer with regard to the benefits an employee should have received. This would include group health plans, retirement plans, group life, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Professional liability/counseling acts liability (nonfee-based and fee-based).</strong> Sometimes people accuse pastors and counselors of physical and emotional harm. This coverage provides for a claim arising from pastoral direction or counseling. Limits should match the general liability limits.</li>\n<li><strong>Garage insurance.</strong> If your church offers valet parking, provides automotive services (like free oil changes to widows or single mothers), or accepts donated vehicles and sells or gives them away, it needs a form of garage liability. The amount of coverage varies depending on the activity of the church.</li>\n<li><strong>Foreign liability and foreign travel insurance.</strong> If members of your church travel outside the continental United States, your basic coverage may have limits or exclusions.</li>\n<li><strong>Workers’ compensation.</strong> Each state has its own version of Workers’ Compensation laws and coverage. In general, Workers’ Compensation insurance covers 100 percent of the medical bills for an employee who is injured on the job due to a job-related activity. Each state determines the percentage by which it compensates lost wages. The employer’s liability portion of this policy covers the employer for any negligent acts that result in injury to an employee. Your agent should be able to assist you in determining the appropriate coverage and limitations required in your state.</li>\n<li><strong>Hired and non-owned autos.</strong> This provides liability coverage for rented automobiles and use of other non-owned autos. In the event that church members or employees are using personal autos, their insurance is primary and this insurance is available only after the primary insurance is exhausted. All churches should have this coverage.</li>\n<li><strong>Medical payments.</strong> This endorsement allows a goodwill payment to individuals who are injured on the church property regardless of fault. Usually it is limited to $5,000.</li>\n<li><strong>Excess liability (umbrella).</strong> This is an added coverage that acts as an umbrella over your other liability coverage should those coverage limits be reached through claims activity. This coverage is for those rare, but extremely expensive, liability claims.</li>\n<li><strong>Business auto. </strong> Any time a church owns its own vehicles, coverage is necessary. Some insurance providers have limitations both on vehicles and drivers. For instance, many will not cover the older 15-passenger vans. Others may limit the age of the drivers. It is recommended that a church has a minimum of $1 million liability limits on its auto policy. This is perhaps the greatest exposure for loss for the average church. Check with your agent for advice on your auto policy and for direction on physical damage to your autos.</li>\n<li><strong>Other coverages.</strong> There are other coverages available depending on the level of need and activity your church is involved in. The key is always maintaining a good relationship with your agent and keeping communication open should you have questions regarding your coverage. Also, if you engage in a new ministry, add a new building or room, or obtain a piece of equipment, contact your insurance professional so he can review your policy for sufficient coverage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Choosing an Agency</h2>\n<p>It is important to place coverage with an insurance company that has a Best’s Credit Rating of A- or better. Also, place coverage with an agent that is knowledgeable about insuring churches. The General Council of the Assemblies of God has a customized insurance program AG Churches. Church Mutual, an A+ rated company with over 100 years experience in insuring churches, underwrites this coverage.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, developing a good relationship with your agent is critical. Openly discussing your needs and current situation with your agent will enable you to better prepare for future scenarios. Keep in mind that your insurance agent is in the best position to clarify coverage, help you understand terminology, and keep your ministries protected. They are your best ally should the unthinkable happen.</p>\n<p>What <strong>liability insurance or risk management practices</strong> have you put in place to protect the people in your ministry?<strong> Share your story below.</strong></p>\n<p>Jerry Sparks, President<br />\nAGFinancial Insurance Solutions<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:jsparks@agfinancialinsurance.org\">jsparks@agfinancialinsurance.org</a><strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><em>Information is from sources deemed reliable.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>You've got vision. Now you need funding. The question is, how much can you afford to borrow? Two AGFinancial church loan experts, <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/consultant/bruce-gibbons-1\">Bruce Gibbons</a> and <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/consultant/randy-smith\">Randy Smith</a>, share some insight into this important question.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Bruce:</h2>\n<p>When I talk with a pastor about a new project, I try to understand the vision before I offer much information in the way of counsel. The more I know about the vision, objectives, and resources, the more I am able to offer financial direction and recommendations. To provide the pastor with a number without having a complete understanding of these three—vision, objectives, and resources—is not providing a service to the pastor or the church. Here are a few of the questions I ask as we collaborate on a financing need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How does the project play a part in the church's vision?</li>\n<li>How much money do you reasonably need for your project?</li>\n<li>How financially strong is the church?</li>\n<li>What is the church’s annual gross and net income?</li>\n<li>Is there any present debt?</li>\n<li>How much cash on-hand will the church have to contribute for the project?</li>\n<li>What is a reasonable timeline for the project (start to finish)?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on the discussion up to this point, I can give them an unofficial estimate of what they can reasonably afford, with the understanding that we need to go through a complete review of the church financials and project to provide a concrete number.</p>\n<p>The very best advice I can give a pastor is to be willing to share the vision and need for funds and to work together with a loan consultant before making a decision to request funding from a lender.</p>\n<h2>Randy:</h2>\n<p>I agree. It’s critical for a pastor to have a detailed conversation with a loan consultant to get a full picture of the church's needs and resources. We also want to assist the pastor and board in understanding how important it is to have a manageable mortgage. Debt can be an awesome tool for vision but also a millstone if improperly used. It's so important that a loan amount stays within the church's existing operating budget and cash flow.</p>\n<p>Here is a checklist of key factors and ratios we look at to determine if the time is right for a church to borrow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Three years of <a title=\"financial statements\" href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/blog/bid103706church-finances-part-ii-the-importance-of-financial-statements/\">financial statements</a>, including income/expense statements and balance sheets</li>\n<li>An annual (balanced) budget</li>\n<li>Positive trends in attendance and income over the past three years</li>\n<li>Positive operating margins each year</li>\n<li>Approximate cash reserves equal to at least one to three months of fixed operating expenses</li>\n<li>Strong missions giving (at least 10% of total giving)</li>\n<li>Personnel costs (salaries, housing allowances and benefits) less than 45% of total income, preferably at 33%</li>\n<li>Annual debt service less than 33% of general (unrestricted and undesignated) income</li>\n<li>Annual debt service plus personnel costs not more than 65% of general (unrestricted and undesignated) income</li>\n<li>Loan to value ratio of not more than 75%</li>\n<li>Excellent payment history on existing/previous loans</li>\n<li>Lead pastor tenure of at least 12 months</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A simple way to obtain a rough estimate of the amount your church can borrow is to multiply your annual undesignated income by three. In other words, a church with an annual undesignated income of $500,000 can generally borrow up to $1.5 million.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, this is just a guideline.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Risk management is the process of protecting the tangible and intangible assets of your church or ministry. <strong>Tangible assets</strong> are physical properties, such as cash, buildings, furnishings, sound systems, computer equipment, etc. <strong>Intangible assets</strong> are the reputation, public image or “brand” of the ministry. <!--more-->Intangible assets are also the people who attend the church, its staff, and its volunteers. Protecting those assets requires <strong>five steps</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifying Risks</li>\n<li>Analyzing Risks</li>\n<li>Controlling Risks</li>\n<li>Financing Risks</li>\n<li>Administration</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Identifying Risks</h4>\n<p>Identification is the most important step in the risk management process. We must know the risks or hazards that threaten our ministry so that we can effectively analyze, control, finance, or administer them. There are several ways to effectively identify your risks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Physical Inspections </strong>include walking through the facilities and property looking for those things that may pose a hazard. Slipping, tripping, and falling accidents account for the vast majority of liability claims, so pay careful attention to anything on your premises that might post a threat.</li>\n<li><strong>Checklists, </strong>including a vehicle inspection prior to trips, help to detect a potential problem.</li>\n<li><strong>Insurance Policy Reviews</strong> should take place on a regular basis as your insurance needs may have changed.</li>\n<li><strong>Leases and Contracts </strong>may not all be written to the advantage of the ministry. Ensure that indemnification clauses or other language does not transfer liability onto the ministry. A good risk manager can help you rewrite the contract to transfer liability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Analyzing Risks</h4>\n<p>The next step is to analyze those risks. We want to know the <em>likelihood</em> of an accident as well as the potential <em>impact</em> of such a loss, should it occur. Analysis can show you <strong>how much a loss will cost</strong> when it occurs as well as future costs such as increased premiums, damaged reputation, etc. Losses do not just affect us today. They can potentially have long-term consequences.</p>\n<h4>Controlling Risks</h4>\n<p>Risk control can be defined as all the actions we take to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of a loss. There are five different techniques for controlling risk:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoidance. </strong>Avoid certain unnecessary risks that may pose a threat to the church or ministry.</li>\n<li><strong>Prevention.</strong> Stop or interrupt the chain of events that lead to an accident or a loss.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduction.</strong> There are pre-loss and post-loss reduction techniques. Pre-loss reduction techniques are steps we take before a loss has occurred to minimize the damage. Post-loss reduction practices are those actions taken after a loss has occurred to reduce the impact of the loss.</li>\n<li><strong>Separation and Duplication.</strong> Ensure that important information, especially your electronic data, is duplicated and stored off site. Make regular backups of your financial information, giving reports, tax documents, or other sensitive information.</li>\n<li><strong>Transfers.</strong> Make someone else assume your liability. It is possible to “physically” transfer risk by allowing another individual or entity to perform the necessary duties. “Contractual” transfers shift the liability onto another by way of a contract. Common examples are <em>hold harmless</em> agreements and <em>indemnity</em> agreements, whereby another entity agrees not to sue and to indemnify (or protect) you in case of an accident or suit. Do not sign a contract that transfers risk and liability to your organization as they can often be negotiated or rewritten to more favorable terms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Financing Risks</h4>\n<p>The financing of risk explores different means to <strong>pay for the risks that we assume</strong>. Insurance helps you pay for losses you incur; it is a form of risk financing. Other parts of risk financing are deductible levels, self-insured options, retentions, etc. Build into your risk management plan (and budget) the means to pay for a risk should an event occur.</p>\n<h4>Administration</h4>\n<p>Administration is the fifth and final step in the risk management process. This is simply the overall management of the process and includes <strong>implementation and monitoring</strong> of all the risk management steps. Administration requires a commitment to the process as well as a willingness to evaluate and, if necessary, change the way we operate.</p>\n<h4>Closing Thoughts</h4>\n<p>Effective risk management compels us to examine the various aspects of our ministries to identify and analyze the various risks we ask our staff, volunteers, and adherents to take. Does our ministry expose others to harm or potential dangers? If so, what are the specific risks? While addressing those issues we can start taking steps to control, as much as is reasonably and financially possible, the risks associated with our ministries. Remember that risk avoidance is the most effective control technique; however, it is often the most difficult to implement. It is tough to ask and to answer “is this particular event/ministry worth the risk it poses”? If we feel it is worth the risk, then it benefits us to take the necessary steps to make that part of our ministry as safe as possible.</p>\n<p>We want to help you in any way that we can. If you would like more information about anything mentioned above including the practical steps (checklists, policy reviews, contract or lease reviews, waivers, hold harmless agreements, etc.), contact one of our certified risk managers at 866.662.8210 or email <a href=\"mailto:info@agfinancialinsurance.org\">info@agfinancialinsurance.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>When shopping for a church loan, it’s tempting to choose a lender based solely on the interest rate they can offer. However, the loan with the best rate may <em>not</em> always prove to be the best choice for a church’s financial future.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>The foundational question to ask as you shop isn’t what the rate is. It’s who will carry the risk—your church or your lender? As you’ll see in this post, basing your choice solely on rate puts the risk on your shoulders. We will show you a better approach. But first, it is important to understand three key interest rate variables.</p>\n<p><strong>Rate reflects risk.</strong></p>\n<p>Lenders are often able to offer a lower interest rate when they assume less risk. Shortening the loan term is one way to reduce their risk. Because the lender expects to get back the full amount loaned, plus interest, within a brief time frame, a shorter loan term allows for a lower interest rate. For example, a 5-year loan term gives a church just 5 years to pay off the entire loan amount. These kinds of short-term loans are called balloon notes because they are set up so that the remaining balance is due in one final payment at the end of the term—the balloon payment. With this kind of loan, the church assumes a higher risk that leaves them with three choices: pay the balance off at the end of the term, refinance with a new loan agreement, or face loan default.</p>\n<p><strong>Fixed rates can be deceiving.</strong></p>\n<p>As a church, you will have a commercial loan, which differs significantly from a residential loan. With residential loans, many people shy away from the phrase “adjustable rate.” In commercial loans, “adjustable” is not necessarily a bad word. Lending institutions and banks often use the term “fixed” to ease the mind of their borrowers. In reality, the long-term, fixed-rate mortgage product that is often seen in residential lending does not exist in the commercial mortgage world. Instead, lenders create a fixed-rate mortgage by shortening the term to 3 or 5 years. Unless you can pay the entire balance of the loan within that short term, you will receive a new “fixed” rate for the term of your next loan. In other words, the lender is still adjusting the rate every 3 to 5 years when the borrower refinances.</p>\n<p>This arrangement most often benefits the lender rather than the church because there is no cap on how much interest rates can increase; the church must simply go with the rates available in the market. With a longer term like 20 years, the interest rate may adjust several times, but your contract will include a rate cap so you will know up front how high the rate is allowed to go. A longer term also eliminates the associated fees and closing costs that come with refinancing.</p>\n<p>Some lenders offer the best of both worlds: the opportunity to keep the same rate for a set period of time (usually 3, 5, or 7 years), with a long loan term (often 20 years). After the specified time period, the rate automatically adjusts, never going higher than what was agreed upon at signing. Through this arrangement, churches get the same amount of time to enjoy a “fixed” rate as they would with a five-year balloon note, but with the added stability of long-term financing.</p>\n<p><strong>Chase the right number: total interest paid over time.</strong></p>\n<p>If you repeatedly refinance short-term balloon notes, not only do you have to pay new (often higher) rates, but your amortization or payment schedule also starts over with each refinance. That means you’ll be paying front-loaded interest again and again. This increases the total interest you pay over time to borrow the same money. Although a longer loan term may include rate adjustments over the years, there will be a cap on the rate and the loan will not be re-amortized. That means <strong>less total interest paid</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Weigh all the risks.</strong></p>\n<p>When comparing loans, it can be tempting to focus only on interest rates. Keep in mind there is a direct connection between rate and risk. As you look at the big picture, consider how much risk you’re willing to take. With its comparatively low interest rate, a short-term balloon note may seem like the best solution for the growth of your ministry. Yet with this option, you risk several things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That you will be able to pay off the loan at the term’s end.</li>\n<li>If you must refinance:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>That the lender will be willing to refinance your loan.</li>\n<li>That interest rates will be the same or lower.</li>\n<li>That your church will be able to qualify for and pay the closing costs of refinancing.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>Exclusively chasing low interest rates could not only cost your church more in the long run, but also put your church in a riskier financial position. A much better approach for churches is to weigh the interest rate against the loan term. Opt for a term that will provide enough time for your church to pay off the loan balance without needing to refinance repeatedly.</p>\n<p>As you search for the loan solution that is best for your ministry, we invite you to <a href=\"https://www.agfinancial.org/find-a-consultant?specialty=church-loans\">contact one of our church loan consultants</a> to discuss your specific situation.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Where would you like to be financially by this time next year? One of the biggest obstacles to financial freedom is a simple lack of planning. Perhaps even more important than determining where you’d like to be is determining how you will get there. <!--more-->To help guide the plan, here are five money management resolutions with the power to dramatically improve your financial outlook this year.</p>\n<h2>1. Reduce debt.</h2>\n<p>Debt is costly—and not just in terms of interest you pay. When funds are tied up in debt, they can’t be invested for your benefit. That means you also lose potential earnings you could have had if you’d been able to invest those funds. To build a more secure future, you must first reduce debt.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you want to bring your total debt load to no more than 25-30 percent of your income and lower if possible. Make a plan to reach this goal over time by identifying the debts you can most quickly eliminate. For example, if your smallest debt is $500 on a store credit card, direct as much money toward it as possible until it’s paid off. Then move on to your next larger debt and repeat the process. This allows you to see quick progress, a powerful motivator to keep up with this resolution.</p>\n<p>One positive outcome of debt elimination is a better credit rating. As you reduce your debt load this year, you may want to obtain your credit score to see where you stand. Every adult is eligible for one free score each year through freecreditreport.com. Additionally, you can consider ongoing credit monitoring with the Credit Karma Mobile app, also free.</p>\n<h2>2. Save strategically.</h2>\n<p>Debt reduction should be balanced with saving. It’s not a good idea to completely stop saving in favor of debt repayment. It’s important to keep at least a small emergency fund of $500 to $1,000 to avoid having to take out additional loans when unexpected expenses occur. As you reduce debt, continue saving, even if you can only manage a small amount. Then, increase it as debts are eliminated.</p>\n<p>Here are a few recommended savings goals to target this year:</p>\n<p><strong>Emergencies.</strong> Aim for three to six months of expenses. Then the inevitable, unforeseen costs of life—health deductibles, car repairs, roof replacements—won’t stress you.</p>\n<p><strong>Large purchases.</strong> Saving up for a car, home improvement project or other larger purchase requires discipline and time, but it is better to delay a purchase than to finance it. To help you reach your goal faster, consider investing your savings so it draws more interest than what is typically earned through a standard savings account.</p>\n<p><strong>Retirement.</strong> Wherever you stand in preparing for retirement, resolve to go one step further this year. For example, open a retirement account if you don’t have one. If you do, begin automatic payroll contributions or increase your current contributions. These small steps will have an enormous impact on your future.</p>\n<h2>3. Become an educated spender.</h2>\n<p>If you’ve adopted the first two resolutions to reduce debt and save strategically, don’t undermine your efforts by spending more than you need to for life’s necessities. Beginning this month, investigate ways to spend smart, starting with the following:</p>\n<p><strong>The mortgage.</strong> Because a mortgage is usually the largest single debt for most households, refinancing it is one of the best ways to significantly increase monthly cash flow. A general rule of thumb is that if you can save at least one percentage point on your interest rate, the money you’ll save over time is worth the cost to refinance. Keep in mind, however, that if your credit score is on the low side, you may need to wait until it improves before attempting a refinance; otherwise, you may not qualify for the best rates.</p>\n<p><strong>Insurance premiums. </strong>Comparison shop your home, auto, health and life insurance to find the best premiums for the coverage you require. In addition, take advantage of every possible discount you can. For example, most companies offer a discount when you bundle multiple types of coverage under them. And some auto carriers offer a discount for paying your entire premium all at once rather than monthly.</p>\n<p><strong>Tax withholding. </strong>Getting a hefty return every year is not the best use of your hard-earned resources. Having too much taken out of your paycheck for taxes is the same as giving Uncle Sam an interest-free loan. Sure, you get the money back, but those funds could have been put to better use throughout the year by investing them or paying off debt. <strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<h2>4. Teach your kids about money.</h2>\n<p>As with most good habits, instilling long-term healthy attitudes toward money in kids is most effective if you start when they are young. This year, try some new ideas:</p>\n<p><strong>Delay gratification.</strong> One of most valuable gifts you can offer your children is an understanding of the difference between wants and needs. Rather than immediately granting a request for a new toy or gadget, establish an age-appropriate waiting period. This does two things: 1) pinpoints true desires 2) increases patience and gratitude.</p>\n<p><strong>Fill a jar.</strong> Label a jar with the name of a toy or something else your child wants. Every time they receive a gift of money or their allowance, have them add a portion or all of it to the jar so they can watch their savings grow.</p>\n<p><strong>Practice tithing and giving.</strong> When they’re old enough to earn an allowance or get paid for odd jobs, show your kids how to tithe and explain why. In addition, practice generosity as a family by helping fund a missionary family or supporting a special project you choose together.</p>\n<h2>5. Adopt a Kingdom view.</h2>\n<p>“But just as you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us—see that you also excel in this grace of giving” (2 Corinthians 8:7).</p>\n<p>As believers, every part of our lives, including finances, should be centered on Christ. God offers financial provision for your needs and His work of sharing salvation with the world. We have the opportunity to use that provision for an eternal purpose. When you give, you’re practicing a spiritual discipline that has the power to increase your faith and your gratitude for all of God’s blessings, not just financial ones. So this year, commit your finances to God, asking Him to help you honor His name and trust in His provision for your needs as you give. He won’t let you down.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Assemblies of God Foundation donors are known for their generosity and passion for spreading the gospel message around the world. This passion was revealed most recently when Don Headlee, executive vice president of AGFinancial, met with Greg Mundis, executive director of Assemblies of God World Missions (AGWM), to deliver a special surprise—<strong>$783,928.89 for missions</strong>.</p>\n<p>\"I was ecstatic and so encouraged,\" said Mundis. \"Of the total, $400,000 was designated for our Unreached Peoples Fund. A primary focus of our work continues to be reaching those who have never heard about Jesus.\"</p>\n<p>He continued, \"This is the heartbeat of God, and these funds are crucial to the need.\"</p>\n<p>Making inroads into unreached people groups is just one of the many tasks AGWM missionaries face on a daily basis, often with few resources. \"It's difficult to have God place something on your heart, but not have the funding to make it happen,\" said Mundis. \"For us, it's an exercise in patience and faith in God's provision. Today I got to witness that provision, and it's going to increase the faith of the missionaries who will use it.\"</p>\n<p>In addition to the Unreached Peoples Fund, missions in Greece, Cambodia, and Northern Asia were funded. Mundis recalls, \"I told Don, 'You have no idea what this means.' And now I get to share this news with our Northern Asia regional director and say, 'You know how we've been praying that God would provide funds? It's taken care of!'\"</p>\n<p>\"Getting to hand deliver gifts like this is one of my favorite things to do,\" said Headlee. \"We have the opportunity to deliver many of these types of gifts, and it never gets old. Seeing the generosity of people on a daily basis is an incredible privilege for our Planned Giving team.\"</p>\n<p>Although donors may not always get to see the fruit of their generosity during their lifetime, its impact is undeniable. \"One thing I want people to understand is that regardless of the amount of the gift, we have the ability to maximize its Kingdom impact through the <a title=\"planned giving tools\" href=\"/planned-giving/planned-giving-tools/\">planned giving tools</a> we provide,\" Headlee remarked. \"So what may seem like a modest gift at first is invested so that its impact for ministry is multiplied. It's a beautiful way to give.\"</p>\n<p>\"On behalf of our missionaries, I want to thank the AG Foundation donors,\" stated Mundis. \"Because of your generosity, your love for Jesus, and your heart for missions, people who would otherwise never hear the message of salvation will now receive a gospel witness. Because of you, there will be more people in heaven.\"</p>\n<p>AGWM remains a leading recipient of funds distributed through AG Foundation, receiving almost $30 million over the last 10 years from planned gifts such as <a title=\"Donor Advised Funds\" href=\"/planned-giving/planned-giving-tools/donor-advised-funds-endowments/\">Donor Advised Funds</a>, <a title=\"Charitable Gift Annuities\" href=\"/planned-giving/planned-giving-tools/gift-annuities/\">Charitable Gift Annuities</a>, and <a title=\"Charitable Remainder Trusts\" href=\"/planned-giving/planned-giving-tools/charitable-remainder-trusts/\">Charitable Remainder Trusts</a>.</p>\n<p>To learn how planned giving can benefit you and the ministries you care about, call <strong>866.621.1787</strong> or email <a title=\"plannedgiving@agfinancial.org\" href=\"mailto: plannedgiving@agfinancial.org\">plannedgiving@agfinancial.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Using church money for personal reasons is stealing. Intention, rationale, or even promises to return funds does not change this fact.</p>\n<p>While it's easy to believe fraud could never happen in your church, the truth is that no church is invulnerable. I've personally seen how common it is among churches. Consider these cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A church treasurer embezzled $850,000 by distributing funds to himself through a credit line. He had access to four officers' digital signatures. His crime led to eight years in prison and the requirement to pay the money back.</li>\n<li>A 55-year-old female church bookkeeper embezzled a modest $3,000 dollars but was sentenced to eight years in prison.</li>\n<li>A church usher collected offerings in the sanctuary balcony and then pocketed loose bills on his way down. Over a number of years, he stole several thousand dollars.</li>\n<li>A church bookkeeper embezzled thousands by issuing checks to a fictitious company.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Church fraud characteristically takes place over a long period of time—seven years on average—and involves small sums stolen intermittently. For that reason, it can be difficult to detect.</p>\n<p>To make matters worse, many churches lack the internal financial controls necessary to expose—and prevent—fraud. To help your ministry with this, we've developed a list of prevention steps you can take below.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, when fraud is discovered, leaders may fail to report it to their insurance company or local authorities. Unfortunately, this sets the stage for future occurrences. Consider the church business administrator who embezzled $350,000 from his church. It was later discovered he had stolen from a previous church that failed to report it.</p>\n<p>Don't put other ministries at risk. <strong>Report fraud </strong>when it happens. </p>\n<h3><strong>Why people steal from the church</strong></h3>\n<p>Most fraud occurs for one or more of these reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>No internal controls.</strong> Without proper internal controls, there is a perceived opportunity.</li>\n<li><strong>Financial pressure.</strong> The embezzler needs money for some reason.</li>\n<li><strong>Rationalization.</strong> An embezzler may think they aren’t paid enough and so deserve the money, or they may consider it borrowing, not stealing.</li>\n<li><strong>Continual exposure to funds in an unsupervised, unregulated environment.</strong> According to some studies, this is a more powerful driver in embezzlement than an actual need for money.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>How to prevent fraud at your church</strong></h3>\n<p>The following list will help you safeguard church funds. In addition, it is recommended to hire an independent auditor, such as a CPA firm, to perform a compilation and review of your annual financial statements and internal controls.</p>\n<p><strong>Internal Controls</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a financial policy in writing.</li>\n<li>Conduct background checks and run credit reports on those handling church funds.</li>\n<li>The signers of checks must not be the person authorizing the expense.</li>\n<li>Require two individuals to sign checks of more than a predetermined amount. The signature documentation (signature card) held by the bank should show this restriction.</li>\n<li>All disbursements should be made by pre-numbered checks and be accounted for weekly.</li>\n<li>Bank reconciliations should be approved by someone not authorized to sign checks or make the deposit and should be done promptly. Look for checks out of sequence.</li>\n<li>Every check written should have written documentation (check request/receipt/invoice) except for payroll checks.</li>\n<li>Invoices and check requests should be marked paid with the date and check number and then filed.</li>\n<li>Do not sign blank checks in advance.</li>\n<li>Implement a credit card policy, requiring prior approval of purchases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cash Management Procedures</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Distribute offering envelopes to members. This helps make cash less accessible and ensures members get credit for their cash giving.</li>\n<li>Require two unrelated cash counters for every service, with each completing an <a href=\"http://files.agfinancial.org/Insurance/Offeringcounterssheet.pdf\">Offering/Counter’s Sheet</a>. Have each counter verify the other’s form.</li>\n<li>Rotate cash counters with different individuals on a weekly basis.</li>\n<li>Counting should be done behind a locked door. Install a camera overlooking the counting area.</li>\n<li>Checks should be stamped “For Deposit Only” immediately.</li>\n<li>Deposits should be made as soon as possible. If a deposit cannot be made immediately, place deposits in a locked bank bag and place into a safe. Use of a night depository is recommended if the bank is closed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you suspect fraud has occurred and aren’t sure what to do, we can help.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <h3 ><em>When any person enters that secret chamber, this statute closes the door upon him, and civil authority turns away its ear.</em></h3>\n<p>The statement above is from a 1931 Minnesota Supreme Court ruling that provided justification for the clergy penitent privilege, upheld in all 50 states today. This privilege renders conversations between ministers and counselees non-admissible in a court of law, allowing ministers to offer spiritual guidance without fear they will be called upon to testify regarding the matter. A privileged conversation is defined by the law as any confidential communication given to a minister acting in his or her professional capacity as a spiritual advisor. Let's look at what each part of that definition means:</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<ol>\n<li ><strong>Communication.</strong> The definition of communication includes any act intended to transmit an idea, whether verbal or nonverbal. This includes speech, letters, phone calls, actions, and even the minister’s observations of a person’s demeanor.</li>\n<li ><strong>Confidential.</strong> There are two views held by state courts regarding confidentiality as it pertains to clergy privilege. In two-thirds of the states, a communication is considered confidential if made privately and not intended for further disclosure except to other persons present for the purpose of the communication. In one-third of the states, privileged communication means a communication made in confidence only to the minister, with no third person present.</li>\n<li ><strong>To a minister.</strong> Communication is not privileged if it’s made to a deacon, board member, secretary, the pastor’s spouse, or any other non-clergy person. Interestingly, more than half of the states define a minister to include a person whom the counselee believes to be a minister. For example, if a counselee has a confidential conversation with a church’s youth pastor who happens not to be a credentialed minister but was believed by the counselee to be a minister, most states would consider the conversation privileged. In general, however, the minister must be officially licensed as such.</li>\n<li ><strong>Acting in a professional capacity as a spiritual advisor.</strong> This is perhaps the most important requirement. For a conversation to be privileged according to the law, the minister cannot be acting as a friend or social acquaintance at the time of the conversation. When a conversation takes place in public or any context outside of a traditional church setting, it’s recommended that a minister always ask why the counselee is speaking to them. Simply ask, “Are you speaking to me as a minister acting in my professional capacity as a spiritual advisor?”</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p>\n<h2><strong>Common questions:</strong></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h4 ><strong>Does the counselee have to be a church member for the privilege to apply?</strong></h4>\n<p>No. As long as the above four requirements apply, the conversation is privileged.</p>\n<h4 ><strong>If you’re providing marriage counseling, does the privilege apply if one of the individuals wants you to testify in court?</strong></h4>\n<p>Yes, in most cases. There may be some argument that could be made that the conversation isn’t privileged if you’re in one of the states where a third person present negates the privilege. This also brings up the question of who may assert the privilege. In every state a counselee may assert the privilege, and in half the states, a minister can assert the privilege.<br />\n</p>\n<h4 ><strong>When might it be appropriate to report something given in confidence? </strong></h4>\n<p>It’s important to understand the difference between clergy privilege and the duty of confidentiality. Privilege simply means the information cannot be shared in court. The duty of confidentiality applies in all contexts and is an ethical matter every minister must navigate carefully. A minister’s duty of confidentiality is breached when they disclose confidences to anyone, anywhere. However, there may be times when it is appropriate to share confidential information, under extreme circumstances where people may be killed or severely injured. There are only nine cases in the history of this country where a minister was sued for breaching the duty of confidentiality. Of those, only three of the cases found the minister civilly liable for sharing confidences. In the other six cases, the courts concluded there was no duty under the circumstances for the minister to keep the confidentiality. So it can be concluded that ministers who decide to share confidential information should not in most cases be held personally liable from a legal standpoint, but they certainly won’t be held legally liable for not sharing. The exception to this rule is child abuse. In 41 states clergy are <strong>mandatory reporters</strong> of suspected or known child abuse.</p>\n<p>For more information about church risk and the role of insurance, call AGFinancial Insurance Solutions at <strong>866.662.8210</strong>.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>One of the top questions asked about church liability has to do with dealing with known registered sex offenders who attend church. What steps should a church take to protect its members from potential harm and itself from a potential lawsuit?</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>First, let it be understood that a church has not been held liable for <em>unknowingly</em> allowing a registered sex offender to attend services. This information relates to <em>known registered sex offenders only</em>. Furthermore, there is no need to perform background checks on everyone in the church. The church’s legal duty to proactively check backgrounds arises when someone is set apart in an official capacity as with employee’s or board members, or those who work with minors in some way, as a volunteer, teacher, transportation provider, etc., or those who have keys to the church.</p>\n<p>When it becomes known to the pastoral staff that a registered sex offender is attending, the church can choose one of the following three responses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li ><strong>Do nothing</strong>. Unfortunately, this is often the approach taken by many churches. This response is not recommended due to its associated legal risks, which include the following: risk that the offender may molest a minor, liability to the church if the person will be working with minors, punitive damages for reckless or gross negligence, liability for board members who failed to implement appropriate safeguards, negative media publicity, and the risk of a potentially uninsured claim (intentional or criminal misconduct is not an insurable risk). Bottom line: in choosing to do nothing, you carry a high risk of harm to minors and of being sued for negligence.</li>\n<li ><strong>Total exclusion of all registered sex offenders from the church.</strong> Although it may appear harsh and unforgiving, this is a valid option that depends on the severity of the person’s crimes. There are different segregations of the crimes for which a person can be placed on a state's sexual offender registry:<br />\n- Tier 1. These are the least severe sex crimes. The person is on the registry for 15 years.<br />\n- Tier 2. These are more severe sex-related crimes and the person is on the registry for 25 years.<br />\n- Tier 3. These are the most heinous sex crimes and the person remains on the registry for life.<br />\nIf you have someone who’s a Tier 3 offender, the best response is to exclude them from attending. Even if the crime(s) occurred decades ago, consider the age of the victim(s); if the incident(s) involved pre-pubescent or early-pubescent children, it should not matter how long ago it occurred, since such a person may be a pedophile (someone with a sexual preference for prepubescent or early pubescent minors). According to an FBI profile, pedophiles are incurable, promiscuous, predatory, and have a high recidivism rate. From a liability standpoint, the risk to minors and to your church in allowing a pedophile to attend may be too high. In addition, exclusion may be the proper response in cases where the victim(s) of the sex offender’s crimes attend the same church.</li>\n<li ><strong>Conditional attendance, according to a signed legal agreement.</strong> This means that the person is allowed to attend provided he or she complies with the conditions of the agreement. This is sometimes viewed as a more merciful response. Worded properly, this can put the church in a position to be viewed as having acted reasonably under the circumstances, which means that it may not be considered negligent. However, a couple things must be kept in mind if this course is chosen. First, this document must be drafted by an attorney and comply with any requirements under state law. Second, careful thought must be given as to the conditions stated in the policy. The following conditions often are inserted in such documents:<br />\n• The offender may not work with minors in any official capacity.<br />\n• The offender may not transport minors.<br />\n• The offender may not attend children's or teens' functions at church.<br />\n• A chaperone must be designated to observe the person at all times while on church premises, never letting the person out of sight. Restrooms, in particular, pose a risk. Many documented cases of child molestation have taken place in a restroom. Always have the chaperone follow the offender into the restroom. In general, the spouse of a sex offender would not be a good choice for a chaperone. Ushers or board members are good candidates. In the case of a minor who has sexually molested another minor, the parents or legal guardians could act as chaperones. In their absence, another designated chaperone may be appointed.<br />\nIt is also recommended that churches adopt a <em>Zero Tolerance Policy</em> for violation of a conditional attendance agreement. Even a single violation should result in the individual no longer being permitted to attend. In addition, it is best to contact your insurance agent or company to review the agreement after it is drafted and reviewed by an attorney. This is for your own protection as many applications for insurance ask if any member, employee, or volunteer (past or present) associated with your organization has been accused or convicted of sexual misconduct. The last thing a church wants is to have coverage denied in the event of a material misrepresentation.<br />\nOne more step should be taken before adopting an attendance agreement. Check with the individual’s probation officer if they have one. Many registered sex offenders have been released from incarceration as a result of a probation or parole agreement. Some probationary agreements prohibit offenders from attending church, and if this is the case, it is essential for church leaders to know it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When faced with the need to deal with a registered sex offender in your church, the point of these recommendations is not to eliminate risk but to reduce it to a manageable level to meet the standard of reasonable care. Ask yourself, how would a jury view your church’s actions? In setting up a policy, you are attempting to act reasonably and with due care for everyone involved, especially the precious children in your ministry.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVemC6lRKA&amp;feature=c4-overview-vl&amp;list=PLS35Et-nHKCyBb23R2pHbuDu-YmGETdQT\">Watch the full Risk Mgmt LIVE video about dealing with registered sex offenders.</a></p>\n<p>For more information about church liability policies, call AGFinancial Insurance Solutions at 866.621.1787.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",

However, AGFinancial automatically designates 100% of a minister’s MBA 403(b) distributions as housing. <strong>It is then up to the minister to determine and report the actual amount of their housing expenses each year on their Form 1040.</strong></p>\n<p>The following expenses qualify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Down payment on a home</li>\n<li>Rent and mortgage payments (principle and interest)</li>\n<li>Real estate taxes</li>\n<li>Property insurance</li>\n<li>Utilities (electricity, gas, water, sewer, trash, local telephone charges, Internet)</li>\n<li>Furnishings and appliance purchases and repairs</li>\n<li>Structural repairs and improvements</li>\n<li>Yard maintenance and improvements</li>\n<li>Home equity loan payments used for housing expenses</li>\n<li>Maintenance items (household cleaners, light bulbs, pest control)</li>\n<li>Home association dues</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Expenses that do NOT qualify include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cleaning services</li>\n<li>Food</li>\n<li>Domestic help</li>\n<li>A second home, vacation home, business property, or farm</li>\n<li>Home equity loan payments used for anything other than housing expenses</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To figure out your specific housing expenses when filing your annual tax return, download the free <a title=\"Annual Housing Expenses Worksheet\" href=\"/blog/ministers-housing-expenses-worksheet/\">Ministers Housing Expenses Worksheet</a>. It’s a great way to make sure you get the most out of your housing allowance each year.</p>\n<p>It’s important to know the IRS does place some limits on how much can be designated as clergy housing allowance.

Ministers with questions about whether they are “retired” for this purpose should consult their tax advisors. Ultimately, the minister must make this decision. Many facts and circumstances may be relevant in determining whether retirement has occurred. For example, if a minister is receiving retirement benefits from a plan and is making contributions to the same plan, the IRS may not consider that minister retired for purposes of the housing allowance and the favorable SECA tax treatment. Similarly, the IRS may view ministers as not retired if they have not had a meaningful break in service or change in work duties. Additionally, the IRS may not view you as retired if you are age 72 or older and have filed the paperwork to delay a required minimum distribution from your retirement account. Ministers and their tax advisors should work together to address the relevant facts and circumstances of each individual case.</em></p>\n<p><em><em>This information is not legal, financial, or tax advice.

    "bodyHtml": "<div>\n    <p>Planned giving allows you to manage your wealth while blessing the ministries you feel called to serve. Through a unique marriage of stewardship and financial planning, it allows you to reach your goals for yourself, family, and ministry. There are <strong>several planned giving options</strong> available including Charitable Gift Annuities, Charitable Remainder Trusts, Charitable Lead Trusts, Donor Advised Funds, and Endowments. This article will focus on Charitable Gift Annuities.</p>\n<p>A <strong>Charitable Gift Annuity (CGA)</strong> is designed to pay income to you and your spouse (or other person of your choice) for the rest of your lives. The rate of the annuity is based on your age at the time of your gift, and whether the annuity is for one person or two. A portion of each annuity payment may also be <strong>tax-free income</strong>. Because you’re making a gift to the ministry of your choice—you may also receive a charitable tax deduction at the time of funding.</p>\n<p>There are some key factors to consider when deciding if a Charitable Gift Annuity is a good option for you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Guaranteed Lifetime Income.</strong> In times of economic uncertainty and volatile markets, the security of a guaranteed fixed income can be very appealing. The CGA payment is paid out for the life of the donor and their spouse. This fixed lifetime payout allows the donor to better plan for expenses such as traveling and medical bills. It also provides financial certainty for the surviving spouse.</li>\n<li><strong>Age of the Donor.</strong> The payout of a CGA is determined by the age of the donor(s). The older the donor the higher the payout of the CGA. Depending on the current interest rate of the market, CGA payout rates are often the most appealing to individuals over the age of 70.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher Payouts.</strong> The current condition of the marketplace has made it challenging for seniors to generate sufficient income from record low interest rates. Investors are left to adjust their lifestyle and expectations as they are faced with the choice between volatile equity markets and historically low rates from traditional fixed-income investments. CGAs provide an alternative that typically has a higher payout rate than traditional fixed-income investments. Once the CGA is established, the rate is locked in, keeping the investor from having the risk of a changing return.</li>\n<li><strong>Tax Benefits. </strong>CGAs also provide tax benefits to the donor. When a CGA is first established, the donor may receive a charitable tax deduction up front for their contribution to the CGA. If a donor is using an appreciated asset such as stock to fund the CGA, they may also avoid the up-front capital gains that are ordinarily associated with selling an appreciated asset.</li>\n<li><strong>Gift to Ministry. </strong>One of the most significant reasons for using a CGA to help reach an individual’s goals is the potential impact it will have on the Kingdom. At the end of the payment period (usually both donors’ lives), the remainder is paid out to ministry. This allows the donor to optimize the individual tax benefit, help reach their financial goals for their family, and have a meaningful impact on the ministry they desire to bless.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>FUNDING AND OPTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>Charitable Gift Annuities can be funded with a minimum of $10,000 cash, stocks, or other marketable securities. CGAs are available in two forms: Immediate Charitable Gift Annuity and Deferred Charitable Gift Annuity. A <a title=\"planned giving consultant\" href=\"/planned-giving/contact/\">planned giving consultant</a> can help you determine which option is best for you.</p>\n<p>Planned giving provides unique benefits to the donor. The different options available allow you to create a custom financial plan that will fit your unique needs and circumstances while providing for your family and blessing others.</p>\n<p><strong>Questions about Gift Annuities or other planned giving options?</strong> Contact us at 877.616.5202 or plannedgiving@agfinancial.org.</p>\n\n\n      </div><!-- /.shell -->",
